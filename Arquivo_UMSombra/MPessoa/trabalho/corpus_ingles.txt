  Interview with Alberto José Gonçalves de Carvalho Proença




  My grandparents, on my mother's side, went to Mozambique during the post-war period. The part of mine
  father, he went to Mozambique at the same time, because he had found a good job. During the boat trip
  from Portugal to Mozambique, my father and mother met, and during that period of almost a month of
  travel, that was when they got engaged.


  All the activities my parents had were always together with their children, with the only exception being
  that they went to the cinema at night and we didn't go, but that was only when we were older.
  We lived in a small environment, we went to school during the day and then on the weekends and weekends
  we spent time with our parents.


  There was a cinema theater and I remember going to the cinema every now and then, on a Saturday afternoon,
  and then walking home. The house was close. But I don't remember, I don't even know what it was like because
  my father, at the time, already had a film camera and was already showing films at home.




  My brother is four years apart, which means he hasn't had much to play with. I wasn't very good with children. Nowadays I
  still see stills from films and I had no way, not even to pick him up, he was clumsy. Even images of the beach, me
  trying to take my little brother, who barely knows how to walk into the water, I had no way of holding him or anything.
  He was a real klutz and we had very different temperaments.




  I couldn't really play with my brother. Four years is a huge difference and I have no images, not even
  memories, of playing with my brother. It's another world that doesn't appear in my collection of childhood
  images.


  The ideas I have about this playing time were essentially outdoors, in the backyard which had several
  trees, mulberry trees that are not like the ones I came to find here in Portugal. They were mulberry trees
  without thorns, with extremely delicious and abundant berries, which even the chickens could get enough of
  and ruined on the ground. There were several mumps trees, for example, in the backyard there were maybe one or two
  coconut trees and a few more trees that I don't remember.


  Some I remember had a white flower that was very beautiful. What I remember most about trees was
  that I liked walking on them and climbing them and being down here and playing. And the kids' houses, from
  my time, as far as I remember were the same thing.


  The first house was in Nampula, it was the house where I lived until I was around 10 years old. I have no
  idea of the size of the spaces, because something is what a person remembers when they are small, in which
  everything that is space is big. I left there when I was 10 years old, I can still remember what the

 house divisions.



  That part of Nampula where I lived was the part inhabited essentially by Europeans and the type of construction was
  perfectly equivalent to that in Portugal. There were still no constructions in terms of buildings.
  I remember that the first building that appeared there was four floors, in which an elevator was mandatory,
  It appeared when I was probably 6/8 years old. It was the city building, and everything else was like houses.



  It was a house that my parents managed to build using a loan to have their own housing, but it was what is called
  nowadays, a semi-detached house. There were two houses next to each other,
  each of them with three fronts and a garden. It was on a street corner and actually had two fronts. One of them was
  the main entrance, it had a garden, and the side part had the entrance for the car.
  Then I moved, where I lived until I was 13 years old and only then did I go to Lourenço Marques. But where I have the
  most memories is in Nampula, which was where I spent my pool holidays.



  In the second house, I lived a hundred meters from the pool, so it was days, mornings and afternoons, at the Nampula
  pool. But never in that spirit of being stretched out in the sun, to catch the sun.
  For me, the beach or pool is synonymous with water, and water means getting in, getting out, playing, swimming,
  catching other kids, running. It was at the time when I really started swimming. I started entering some local competitions.
  But being in water isolates or protects us from infrared, and you don't get burned, but it doesn't protect you from ultra
  violet. The problems I have with my skin today are due to that childhood.




  There were very few Africans going to the pool. It was the railway company's swimming pool and it was only for members
  and it was all Europeans. The people who had homes and spent holidays at the beach were only Europeans. The places
  had buildings with different characteristics, which we called “huts”. There weren't many living in concrete,
  cement and block buildings.
  There were already Indians, there were several mestizos, but the local population, at least at that time, in the 60s, was
  very small.



  Then in Lourenço Marques I came to find a very different world, there was already a lot of population there.
  In smaller areas, in small cities in the north and in the interior, it was not normal for the African population to be
  in these types of neighborhoods.



  ## Children's house ##




  The first house was in Nampula, it was the house where I lived until I was around 10 years old. I have no idea of the
  size of the spaces, because something is what a person remembers when they are small, in which
  everything that is space is big. I left there when I was 10 years old, I can still remember what the rooms were like.

  ## From school to school ##




  I went to a school with siblings from the age of 5 until I was in kindergarten, because until that age, the ones who took
  care of me while my parents worked were my grandparents. But when I was 5 years old, they put me in a convent
  school, like a free-time occupation, where I spent my mornings.
  and afternoons. Instead of walking around the playground, I saw what the older people were learning in class. So I did the
  equivalent of first class. I actually took the first class exam.




  I barely remember the convent school, I have a vague idea of the layout of the buildings. I remember something I really
  liked there, it was certain days of the week when they distributed the host shavings. The hosts were made there
  and everything that was trimmings, and I really liked that and was there ready, so that at the time of distribution, I
  could keep some of those trimmings. That's the only thing I remember about that convent school.




 After primary school itself I have few memories. I occasionally remember some of the games I played at recess, which
 today I still try to see if they exist or not. There are now some of the games I see in primary school that are similar. I
 remember the type of desks in the classrooms, but
Machine Translated by Google
  I don't remember the rest. I can remember one or another attitude or behavior at fourth grade level, but I don't have
  great memories of the first years.



  I played with kids my age. At 5 years old, a year difference is a lot. For a person who is in the second class, those in the first
  class are children who don't care, and those in the third class are from another generation, often the idols who we try to
  approach to have contact and a conversation, but it's another generation that doesn't care about us either.




  At that age there is a very large segmentation or distance between the kids, and a year's difference is enough to separate
  kids. A kid in second class doesn't mix with kids in first class, they're "kids", aren't they. Those in the third and fourth are
  the oldest and don't care about those in the first.




  In the middle of my third year of high school, I was 12 years old, I went to Lourenço Marques. Heart problems were
  detected in my father and he came to Lourenço Marques to undergo surgery for the stomach pains he was complaining
  about. At the time of the operation, they detected that he was suffering from coronary thrombosis, heart problems, and
  there were no conditions in Nampula, there was no cardiologist, to monitor him in terms of heart disease. So, he asked for
  the transfer, as it was
  postal worker, to Lourenço Marques and we all had to go to Lourenço Marques for him
  be able to have medical follow-up.



  I completed high school in Lourenço Marques and completed seventh grade in Oeiras, Portugal. It was during one of those
  periods when my mother came here on a graceful leave. At that time, only my mother came because my father had already
  died, and I completed my seventh year here.



  Then I entered university, in Lourenço Marques, where a good part of my teachers from that university are at the University
  of Minho. Therefore, I was a student, for example, of Professor Chaínho. I was a Physics student here, taught by Professor
  João Ferreira; by professor Isabel Ferreira. I was a student of Professor Vasco Freitas, of José ManuelValença. At Electrónica
  de Guimarães, I was a student of professor Carlos Couto. I became a student of Civil Engineering professor Barreiros Martins.
  I didn't become a student of João deDeus Pinheiro, but I did get a ride home from him. I didn't become a student of
  Professor Machado dos Santos, who was in England at the time, otherwise I would have been his student too.




  ## Multi-racial society ##




  I came to Portugal a few times because public servants, who were in Mozambique and the former colonies, had the right to
  so-called "gracious leaves", meaning they could come to mainland Portugal for several months on vacation and then get
  involved more usually between six months and one year. People managed to get a free license almost every six years.




  I remember coming in 62 and 70 on these graceful leaves and practically staying in mainland Portugal for a year. After that
  I only returned right on the eve of independence. I actually left Mozambique a month before independence. There was no
  way he could continue to lead a minimally normal life. In fact, I understand that even today, there are no conditions for
Machine Translated by Google
  live a normal life within the more or less generic concept of what is normal. The type of life that people lead anywhere in
  Europe is not possible in Mozambique and, at the moment, not even in South Africa.




  We often went to South Africa. Just as people here often go to Spain, we went to South Africa to shop because the South
  African market was much richer. That image that we have today of what Australia is, was the image of South Africa and
  Australia, in the 60s and 70s. It was a very English-influenced type of life with a lifestyle of the English in the colonies,
  their habitats, their "modus vivendi" with wide spaces and a different type of commerce. It was another world. I
  remember going to Johannesburg, Pretoria, which were the closest, and that at this moment it is not possible to live the
  kind of life that was done at that time.




  What I always saw, the majority of Africans, black people who lived in my circle of relationships, most of them were
  equivalent to the classes here, like the working class or even domestic servants, therefore this level of relationship. There
  was no automatic association, that is, due to the fact that it was
  black has these types of characteristics, no. I had highly qualified African colleagues, with whom I got along as equals, but
  that's it, I had two African employees and all my neighbors had servants who were African. All the work considered to be
  of lesser standard was done by Africans .




  Something very similar to what Portuguese emigrants in Paris felt a few years ago.
  And there is probably a very large similarity in the populations of Central and Northern European countries in relation to
  emigrants.



  The case of the Portuguese then and now, the Algerians in France, the Turks in Germany or the Indians in England, the type
  of relationships are exactly the same. They occupy those places, perform those functions that the local inhabitants no
  longer like to perform and that was what happened in Africa. It doesn't mean that they were inferior, but they couldn't afford
  to do this type of work, and little by little they began to feel at a disadvantage. There were a few or so people who surpassed
  this barrier.




  I felt that it was a multi-racial society, but that it had started from a base in which the European community had an advantage.
  I remember being a bit confused when I discovered that even in Nampula there were some white people who lived
  in huts and that was happening inside my home.
  conditionality, in terms of day-to-day experiences. It wasn't normal but it already happened. There were already white
  people who lived in huts, often in a sequence of mixed marriages or mixed gatherings. But it didn't seem to me that they felt
  unhappy, that was what confused me, because I associated that kind of life with a life of lower quality, in which the
  person tends to assume, if the person lives in a better house, they have better quality of life, than someone who lives in
  a worse house. At that age it was still not possible to distinguish or have a clearer concept that quality of life is not just
  associated with external well-being.




  In Mozambique there was a better quality of life than in Portugal. Not only were the salaries higher, but there was a much
  more open mentality, influenced by South Africa. I had a huge shock when I came here. People were petty, they fought
  and fought over small, insignificant things.
Machine Translated by Google
  In Mozambique life was more open. People had no worries even at an economic level. Not only were salaries better,
  houses were cheaper, there were more possibilities to buy a house, there were good roads. People traveled more
  by car. Even in terms of food, the meat there was half the price of the meat available here. There were other living
  conditions, so the people who were there, if they were able to work there, preferred to stay there. What tied them
  to the metropolis was a family bond, nothing more, at least in Mozambique it was like that. In Angola it was a little
  different.




  The 25th of April completely changed our perspective on life. I mean, I was feeling good in that land and I had all the
  plans to make my life in Mozambique. Portugal for me, the metropolis was, according to today's language, "a drought". A
  very different way of thinking. Whereas nowadays a person feels "well this is part of Europe". At that time, this was a
  life delay and it was difficult for me to come on the 25th of April. It was very difficult for me to understand at the time, despite
  all the political campaigns, the brainwashing they did, and all the publicity, the mistreatment by PIDE. We lived peacefully
  there, we didn't feel that there was war or those problems.




  We knew it existed, all the military were there, in fact, Nampula was the general headquarters, but in Nampula I never felt
  anything, nor in Lourenço Marques, neither acts of terrorism nor anything. It was much safer to live there during wartime or
  in any city. Near the north and in Cabral, that was where the war was, but otherwise, in urban areas it was much safer to live
  at that time than it is now.




  I came to Portugal a month before Mozambique's independence, which in turn occurred after April 25, 1974.




  In September 74 there were some attempts to go around Mozambique. Then the first problems began when there
  were the first massacres and the first issues in Mozambique.
  In Lourenço Marques there started to be revolts, the buses were overturned. Then we were shocked, because the
  university was on the outskirts of Lourenço Marques. Therefore, the bus had to pass through the neighborhoods, where the
  Africans lived and we took the last bus that came from the university to the city, because the next one was stopped
  and set on fire with the people inside. This was all after the 25th of April, so it was already in October or November, because
  there had never been the slightest problem before. We went to bars, to African fairs, we moved anywhere without any security
  problems. The problems only started after the 25th of April, following the 25th of April.

  ## Being a student ##




  The first time I came to Portugal was in 62/63, I don't remember, I was 8 years old, it's still a little early. At that time,
  my parents rented a room in Lisbon, where we spent
  part of the time. But during my studies I stayed at a school in Porto Mós, with friends, while my brother stayed with other
  friends. He wasn't yet at school at that time and was closer to my parents. But I don't remember much about that time.




  At that time, when a person goes from one country to another, what is at stake is not whether the country is different or
  not, but what is much more important is the people you are with, your day-to-day life, how they are or No, and then I felt a
  difference. The mentality in Mozambique was very different from the mentality here.



  I returned a second time in May to finish the course, it was at the end of the academic year, I was coming to Coimbra to
  finish my fourth year. I chose Coimbra because it was the university that had the course most similar to what I was taking
  there, which was Electrical Engineering, and that way I managed to finish the course.
  With the transfers and equivalencies I managed to finish the course in the year I had left. Effectively
  I finished the course in the fifth year. It was one of those classic Engineering courses that existed in Porto, Coimbra and
  Technique in Lisbon. But Lisbon didn't interest me, it was too big a city, I preferred a closer city, like the city I was
  used to living in in Mozambique.




  At the time, I had studied the curricula of the different courses, and the course at the University of Coimbra was the most
  similar to that of Lourenço Marques. Therefore, this meant that when making equivalences one would have to
  take fewer subjects. But I went to Coimbra in a year of transition. Engineering courses,
Machine Translated by Google
  in Coimbra they were trying to impose themselves, they were not accepted by the Ministry. There
  was a very big war. The university wanted Engineering courses in Coimbra, because in Coimbra
  there were only preparatory years, the first three years, then people had to go to Lisbon or Porto,
  and Coimbra tried very hard to keep these courses, even with other wishes of the Ministry, so
  there were all these wars.


  A year of transitions, without installations. I remember in the first year, fourth year, that I was in
  Coimbra, the classes were in the Anthropology department, so we were sharing these classrooms
  classroom. The following year we went to occupy the facilities that Physics had left because it had moved
  new facilities.


  The old facilities were not suitable and for those who come from a country with a hot climate,
  arriving here will experience the Coimbra winter, which is cold and dry, classes without heating. I
  went to class in a coat, scarf and gloves, I was extremely cold because I wasn't used to the cold.


  I didn't like the university environment at all. It was that post-revolution environment, in which
  everything opportunistic came to the fore. Decisions were made in plenary sessions
  manipulated by those individuals. It was a little difficult for me to see that. Even what they
  were doing to people we held in high regard, but who were poorly regarded by the Red Brigades.
  It cost a lot because there was a good working environment in Lourenço Marques among
  colleagues, and among colleagues and teachers that I didn't find in Coimbra.


  That year in Coimbra took a toll on me, especially in winter, the temperature, being alone in Coimbra,
  the fact that it was difficult to do more outdoors because in Lourenço Marques, even though I was
  far from the university, I would often go for a walk for half an hour, 1 hour. It was good to go
  for a walk for two reasons: firstly because it's nice to walk in the open air and secondly, because
  during the walk it was a time when the person could be relaxed, making the most of those
  periods. In Coimbra, this cost me much more because walking outside in rain and wind is not easy. Then in
  I was in a rented room, I had no conditions at home, I couldn't even have a room with great
  conditions because my mother had only returned with a pension, and civil servants' pensions are
  not famous, so there were economic difficulties. It cost a little.


  Almost all of my colleagues came to Portugal, but each one went to their own university and
  none of my colleagues went to Coimbra. During that time, my mother lived with my grandparents,
  who had a house in Torres Vedras. Then he rented a room, a small house in Coimbra. At the time,
  there was very little construction. I remember when I was looking for a house
  To rent, I ran all over Coimbra, from one end to the other, I went to every building and asked to see
  if there was anything and nothing. So, it was difficult there. So I had to rent a kind of room, a mini-
  apartment, which I got and lived with my mother and my brother. The conditions weren't famous,
  but it was just this year.


  At the end of the fifth year, I got married right after and from the time we got married we created our own
  independent life. My mother stayed in Coimbra for a while longer, then left and went to live, for a
  while, with my grandparents until she then bought a house in Caldas. Therefore, now she lives
  independently in Caldas.

  the Red Brigades. It cost a lot because there was a good working environment in Lourenço Marques among
  colleagues, and among colleagues and teachers that I didn't find in Coimbra.




  I met my wife in high school. This contact was not from a colleague because she was not on the same course as me.
  What happened during those years is that we both came to Coimbra. Choosing Coimbra wasn't just my course, it was mine
  and hers, to see which city in Portugal allowed us to
  to stay. She had family in Coimbra and stayed at her aunt and uncle's house, but I found a room 20 or 30 meters away,
  on the same street. Which meant that we walked to the university every day and came and were together, otherwise I would
  have actually gone to the pond that year.



  Meanwhile, I finished the course in July and in August we decided to get married. We didn't get married in August
  because, well, they say "Marriage in August is a month of sadness", there's something like that, and therefore the family
  didn't let us get married in August, it could be bad luck. So we got married on the first weekend of September.




  Our marriage was troubled. It was a risk. We got married, we were both unemployed, we had no money, we had nothing, it
  was a risk. We had a straw with good grades. I was 18 and my wife was 17, so the grades were never too high for
  inflation. We had prospects of getting a good job, but we got married without a job, without a home, without anything.

  We built everything else together.
Machine Translated by Google
 The mentality nowadays is very different. We see people who only get married after having the house completely set
 up, all the appliances and the car installed, and sometimes they spend many years dating, each at their parents' house
 to save a few pennies. They equip the entire house and only after everything is assembled do they get married.




  Back then, everything worked a little differently. It was more important to be together than to have a well-equipped
  house, so we preferred to get together. The furniture we had was our bedroom furniture, which we had bought in
  Mozambique, had it made, and then everything else we did. We made the lamps, we made the sofas, we improvised
  everything, but we were together and it was more important than anything else. A different philosophy.




  ## university teacher ##




  After getting married it was a matter of trying to find a job for me and my wife. Even though we had good grades, there
  were no jobs. The market was in a huge contraction, it was difficult to find a job. In any case, we applied to different
  universities. Then it was just a question of being able to fit into a university that would accept both of us.




  We fled Lisbon, we put small cities first. We chose Aveiro first. Coimbra didn't interest us, we knew Coimbra, but either
  way we ran for Coimbra. My department still accepted vacancies, hers did not. I also ran for Porto, for Nova
  de Lisboa. Neither Nova de Lisboa nor Aveiro admitted people. In Aveiro, people wanted me to go there because
  they knew me from Lourenço Marques, part of my former department was in Aveiro, but they didn't have space
  there. I was admitted to the University of Porto and Coimbra. I gave up on Coimbra and stayed in Porto.




  My wife had family in Porto and came to live with me. We tried to get her to stay in secondary education and she
  was placed in a land that is to be forgotten, somewhere south of Coimbra, I don't know the name of it. It was a journey
  that was very difficult for him to make, only for us to get there later and find out that, after all, there had been a mistake
  in the placements and he was not placed there. That first quarter or last quarter of '76, I don't even know where she
  was teaching anymore.



  I started teaching at FEUP, but it was at night, not motivating, with no prospects of doing a PhD in the short
  term. There were around 90 assistants, all of whom wanted to do the same. So the opportunity arose here in Braga. I
  didn't know there was a university here, it was Professor Romero who did the interview at the time and was very excited
  and wanted me to come. Professor Machado dos Santos did too, in fact, he hired me and I became his assistant,
  sharing the same office. I gave practical classes in his subjects, and my wife joined at the same time. We entered
  the University of Minho in January or February 1977. We started with a rented room, as soon as we could we rented
  a house. At the time we didn't want to stay in the center, we rented outside the city and even today we are well outside
  the city.




  In Mozambique it was a small world, people knew each other, so entering this university was a continuation of the
  experiences I had in Lourenço Marques. The environment we lived in was nothing that compares to the
  environment we have here. The University
Machine Translated by Google
  It grew immeasurably, I have no idea of the number, maybe we had two, three thousand students, it was relatively small.
  The extremely positive environment, in relation to the environment that existed here in Portugal at the time of the post-25th
  of April, that I experienced.



  Here in Portugal there was a very negative reaction to full professors, and I caught that atmosphere in Coimbra. An
  extremely negative environment. And I was so confused because neither I nor any of my colleagues in Lourenço Marques
  felt any negative reaction towards the teachers, because we had a generation of new teachers there. While a generation of
  teachers was already installed here, already of a certain age, with little scientific value, with a set of vices and arrogances.




  The University of Lourenço Marques sought out almost all recent PhD staff from English schools, with a very open
  spirit. It was a new university, with new people and a very good working environment, which in the end was managed to be
  transferred here, in the initial phase of the University of Minho.




  ## Continuous growth ##




  The University of Minho, in the early years, had the same environment as the University of Lourenço Marques because
  almost all the teachers who came here came from Mozambique and Angola. This university of ours remained with almost all
  those from Mozambique, with the exception of the Chemistry department, which remained at the University of Aveiro.
  Here the Chemistry department is basically made up of people who came from Angola, but almost all other departments
  started with people who
  They came from Mozambique, even one of the English teachers here was my third year high school teacher in Mozambique.




  To D.Pedro V, those are apartments and each apartment has the typical design of a living room and several bedrooms,
  and one of the rooms or two rooms in the department on our floor were opened and were the Centers
  of IT, where the computers were.



  The rooms were the teachers' offices. One of the rooms was internal. I was lucky, I was in an office that had a window
  overlooking Bom Jesus, at the time I shared it with Machado dos Santos. The university was basically that, then it started to
  grow with the pavilions. I also witnessed the growth of the pavilions along the Rodovia, in the annexes of D.PedroV. The
  amphitheaters and those meeting rooms
  classes were much later. Later, in front of the Gulbekian school, those apartments were rented. The department moved
  to that place, to the first floor and Electronics was on the ground floor. The university grew around there.




  Largo do Paço was always the newest part, where the administrative service and the rectory service were located, but
  they only occupied the Largo do Paço part. I still remember going to a Cravo concert, in Largo do Paço, where at the
  moment, if I'm not mistaken, the accounting department is located, above a space that used to be the academic service,
  this room there is a Very beautiful room, I've been to a harpsichord concert. Therefore, the University of Minho had some
  dignity in that area but there were also few of us.

  Little by little the university grew and, nowadays, I don't even know all my colleagues in the department,
  let alone at the university. At that time, I knew everyone at the university. It was a small half ten, 15
  people. In fact, when I joined there must have been four or five teachers, if that, and we knew them all. It was
  very different! Today, there must be 70 teachers in the IT Department. The department must now be larger
  than the university at the time I
  I entered. I am professor number 44. When I joined there were 44 professors at the university and the
  department now has 70. The people who were there at the time all remain, one or two people left, but the
  the rest remain the same.



  There were much fewer students, they were much closer together, there was not so much mass. One of the
  great drawbacks of this massification is a certain irresponsibility that comes behind it. Although I see that
  I have 200/300 students enrolled in my classes, I never see more than 100 or 150. At that time, I probably had
  80 students enrolled but I was able to see 60 or 70. Therefore, it was a more generalized teaching.
  People were closer. When they arrived at university, they worried about attending classes and, finally, working
  while they were at university. Nowadays it's very different and that shocks me a bit. When a person
  goes to teach a class and sees it, not even the first few classes.
  Because one thing is if you don't like the teacher, you go there once or twice and don't like it and stop setting
  foot there. Another thing is never setting foot, and that bothers me. Today I have so many people
  registered and no one does anything.


  In the past, we didn't feel massification, it wasn't fashionable, what we wanted was straw. Nowadays everyone
  wants to have a straw. There is a difference: it is one thing to have the right to enter university and
  Another thing is the right to have a straw. But there is a difference in mentalities. At that time, it was
  understood that the straw was for those who had the skills. Nowadays, a person thinks that even without skills
  they have the right to have a higher education. If we enter into a model that is more similar to the Japanese
  model, in which almost everyone has a higher education degree, and Europe tends in that direction, what
  will happen is that a higher education degree will be worthless afterwards. And right now that's what happens.
  Every Japanese person has a higher education degree and a Japanese higher education degree has little value.



  I've never seen any standard system and as it exists now with this degradation it's only a few years old.
  I mean, after all, what they are trying to do is revive the practices that previously existed in classical
  universities. Now there has never been anything as degrading as this and when there was, they were in
  more controlled and limited periods and only at certain times of the year. I never caught anything like that,
  not even at my University in Lourenço Marques, there was never anything like that, and when I came to the
  metropolis, to Coimbra, there was nothing like that. The practices were associated with Hitler's regime, they
  were related to the fascist regime, and no one dared even think about any type of demonstration of this kind.
  Therefore, it took almost a generation for them to emerge again.




  I think that practices can have very positive things. I have been following what is happening with practices at other universities
  in Portugal and they have a different spirit. They have a much greater spirit of inserting the young people who enter, trying
  to insert them into the community where they will study, telling them how things work, what the rules are and, eventually,
  some tricks that go beyond the less sensible rules. But it is an effort of integration, there may be some jokes in between,
  but nothing that resembles what we see here, which I think are attacks on people's dignity.

  In the last 20 years I have not taught first year, first semester classes. It was only relatively recently that I
  started teaching first year classes, but it was in the second semester. But, I mean, if I taught first year
  classes, in the first semester, I would have to do something, what I don't know, but
  I had to find some way to protect them, because what is happening doesn't seem right to me. They come
  here sometimes, finish secondary school, have worked hard and some come here with the expectation
  of maintaining the same pace of work. There are others who don't - "Now I've entered university and I won't
  work for the next six months." But there are others who come with the desire to
  work, they catch this in front of them, they start to get discouraged.


  I think it's already a big shock. Those who live here are with their families, but now those who come from
  abroad have to suffer all this, I think it's difficult. They are already suffering separation because they spent
  their entire lives with their family, now suddenly they come here to spend it alone. For the first time in their
  lives, perhaps, they have to find an apartment, a room. They completely change their lifestyle, they are
  discouraged, scared. It is a stage that must be quite difficult in the lives of many students, especially
  those who come from abroad. And we expected some understanding from the older people, who have
  already been through this, to help them to integrate, to be able to show where the library is, where this is,
  where that is, where you can eat well or not, where can eat outside the university, since the
  canteen sometimes has inconveniences. I mean, they had all the games, but that kind of coexistence was
  more important than putting on this kind of show, which is degrading and the only ones having fun are
  those dressed in black, no one else. Not even the young people themselves have fun, nor do people
  passing by think it's funny. It's degrading.

  ## Good relationship with the Portuguese communities ##




  For two years that we were working in Portugal, we lived with the goal of saving money to be able to do our
  PhD abroad. As soon as we could we went to Manchester. In the academic year of 78/79,
  we were in England doing our PhD. We were there three years. We had our house rented here, we paid the
  rent there. What is certain is that after coming from England I had more years in
  England than in mainland Portugal. I had three in England, I knew the way of being and the mentality of the
  English better than the Portuguese who were here, and it was a huge shock.
  It was really difficult for me to return to this delay in my life.


  In England we were both together and that was very important, and I still think that the best years of my life
  were those years we spent with our colleagues. We had it at a time when there were a lot of Portuguese
  people. There was a very large Portuguese community in Manchester.


  We even created a folk dance group. We got support from the Tourism Office in London, who sent us the
  facts. We organized our own Portuguese community parks. We were even asked by other communities to
  perform our folkloric dances at other people's parties. Therefore, it was still a group of around 20 Portuguese
  who were there doing their postgraduate studies and it was an extremely positive time for the people
  who were there. I don't think a moment like this has ever happened again, with so many Portuguese people
  being together with common interests.




  We socialized regularly. I remember there was a time when one of those colleagues wanted us to go to his
  house for dinner and we had to follow our schedule, and it was only two months later that we had a date
  available to go to his house for dinner. And there was another colleague who even made fun of us, saying that
  we were in England for tourism and that we were doing our PhD in our spare time. In fact, we worked
  from Monday to Friday, from morning until night it was university, but then on Friday we disappeared and
  the weekend was off. And so we traveled all over England from one end to the other, always spending
  weekends away. Those were good times!


  Then we returned to Portugal and a new lifestyle began, because it was from there that the children
  started to come. We did the math so that they would only arrive after we had secured our doctorate, because
  otherwise there wouldn't be a doctorate. And that was when my wife
Machine Translated by Google
  The experimental part of her doctoral work was finished, and we decided that she could get pregnant, because she
  is a Chemistry major and in the laboratory it is extremely dangerous to work in these conditions. She finished the
  experimental part and only afterwards did she get pregnant.



  Our kid was made in England but came here to be born. She finished her doctorate and had to come here earlier, because they
  wanted her to come and teach here. As soon as she gave her oral in December, they wanted her to come teach in January.
  Therefore, she came here alone in January to teach, she came for six months.




  How I stayed there alone and managed to write the thesis in two months. When she came, I only had part of a chapter and a little
  of the annex made. And on February 15th I was giving the oral. So, she then went to England, in mid-February, to dismantle the
  house and we came by car with all the stuff. A stroller equivalent to the Uno that was my Fiat 127. In terms of luggage, it fits


  a lot of things, that's what I told people "This takes a lot of luggage, until the finite height of putting things on the roof".




  And that's it, we've always lived this kind of life. I remember a trip we took from Porto was a little complicated. There were two
  mattresses and a carpet rolled up on top of the roof, it looked like
  a battle tank with a cannon. At that time, people got along with everything.




  Life has been more monotonous since our first child was born here. From the time children are born, this means that they
  demand a lot of attention and when they demand a lot of attention, the rest fall behind. We pay less attention and devalue other
  activities. People are often not aware of this.




  We are now starting to reap the rewards. We see now, the oldest kid at 18 years old, we can say that he has already passed
  the critical phase of adolescence. The 15-year-old girl is entering or in the middle of the critical phase of adolescence, which
  everyone complains about as being very boring, very ungrateful, a phase
  of rebellion and I never felt these problems. And I suspect that this happens because we paid a lot of attention to them when
  they were little. We never had problems with adolescence and we don't anticipate that we might have any. They have been
  the main objective all these years.



  From the time the kids were born until practically a few years ago, I think we only started going to the cinema every two
  or three years. Before that, we didn't even leave them alone at home or go with them and that's another story.




  We liked to walk through the mountains. I remember that I was one of the first people, in Portugal, to have that type of backpack
  on my back, where I could carry the kids or even on the front and systematically I was the one carrying the kid.
  He walked through the mountains. I ran this whole region of Gerês with the kids and the holidays were always camping
  holidays, with tents. It was to encourage a much more open-air type of life, so that they felt the pleasure of life outdoors, in
  the mountains, the pleasure of life in contact with nature. We have always had this type of encouragement towards them
  and our prayers have always been camp prayers, even today. Today there are those who make fun of us, therefore, the
  turnaround of our camping has reversed, we have moved to a star camping, it is no longer a tent, it is a caravan. None of our
  kids would accept us going on vacation renting an apartment, or whatever, they won't do it.
Machine Translated by Google



  While they were little we were always close by, we were there in Foz do Minho, here
  in Cabedelo, in Caminha, this is because the kid had problems with ear infections since he was very little, and we
  constantly had to not risk going too far from home.



  With the girl, it was more stable, so when she was 4 years old we took the risk of leaving, and it was the first year that we
  actually left Portugal with the kids and went looking for warm waters.



  As a Mozambican, I can't bathe in these waters, just by getting my feet wet I feel like I'm giving birth as soon as I'm in
  the water. In Foz do Minho when the tide goes out, you can take a bath because the water is a little warmer, otherwise it is
  impossible. So, we went to
  the coast of Spain try a set of beaches south of Barcelona and from there, we found a campsite, which is more of a tropical
  garden and a type of mixed park, amusement park and a garden, which the kids liked and since 90 that we go there every
  year. Whether we or the nephews later on, vacation for them is Baracas, the name of that land. We were able to go to
  several places, but we always have to end the last fortnight of August on this beach. For the rest, we take them to
  explore wherever we could go.




  There was a year we spent in Paris, the first fortnight of August, another in Switzerland, another in England,
  another in Austria, another in the United States. So there is always, and this is what the girl, even now 15 years old,
  what she likes most about holidays is this period of living together with her family, because it is the only period when we
  are together and paying attention to each other, because otherwise of the year, it's them with the school problems, it's us
  with the problems here at the university, plus exam problems and I don't know what else. During the vacation period we
  leave Braga and turn off everything, we never take work abroad. So the four of them work together 24 hours a day
  and that's important.
  Since they were little, they got used to having this great experience with us and they can't do without it.



  I live in a house from the beginning of the 18th century, which I restored a few years ago. I kept the entire structure from
  the outside, I tore down everything that was inside, which had been restored in the 40s, it still had a 40s style room, with
  a rotten and falling down floor. As I wasn't interested, I tore down everything inside, I only took advantage of the doors,
  which were brown. It was a completely restored house and I have around two thousand meters of land
  around it, with terraces.



  I have space, I have grass, I'm usually the one who takes care of the grass, I have fruit trees, terraces with
  pine trees, oak trees, chestnut trees, so I live in the middle of the countryside. This is the Este river valley, in fact if you
  go to see the address S.Mamede d'Este.



  I'm five minutes from the university, that is, now with the traffic chaos I'm five minutes away.
  minutes but I have to take shortcuts above or below. This whole side of the city, as long as there are no buildings here,
  and I hope there aren't, as I'm on the side of the hill and the hill is rocky, there may not be any buildings there, I think
  there is some quality of life, which It doesn't happen here with Vale de Lamaçães, which was destroyed.




  ## Old friendships ##
Machine Translated by Google

  There are some strong friendships with colleagues, but these come from before they were colleagues, so I already
  knew some of them as younger kids, in the specific case of Zé João himself. I know Zé João from the time when he was
  camping with me, when we went to high school and camped in Gerês, he and his group. This is knowledge from that time. I
  know other colleagues from the time in Manchester, when we were involved in parody. Therefore, the strongest relationships
  with colleagues are those in which there was something more than work relationships. And when we talk outside, we don't
  talk about work. Sometimes we had conversations

  our house in Manchester, with people who are now here in the department, a conversation until 3, 4 o'clock in the morning,
  nothing to do with work.



  Here in Portugal it is more difficult because, however, when we come here, whether we or they get married and have
  children, it becomes much more difficult to have a relationship. We are keeping with some, but these are more sporadic
  cases. There are no strong connections with anyone in particular, there are with several. Sometimes a person goes to
  one person's house, another person's house with the kids. But the kids also depend on whether they get along at school
  and there is a good relationship or whether it is just sporadic. We have this concern, that the friendship relationships we
  have are friendship relationships between the whole family. So, if there's no connection, if it's too boring for the kids,
  nowadays to face a certain person, we won't go. What matters is that we all feel good.




  ## City of automobiles ##




  Braga was the last option because I didn't know the University of Minho professionally, but once I did, I adopted it and
  I liked it. I mean, I lived with a lot of people and at the moment I feel like I'm a Minho, although at the moment I don't like
  Braga, which has grown too much in recent years.




  The fact that I don’t live in the city center is what’s different. In the center it was difficult to find a house or at least a
  house with a yard, this relationship is important. Living in a building, where a person enters the elevator and leaves the
  house for the elevator, was not my thing. I never lived in those conditions and I would never be able to, so I had to
  find a house that had some extra space. And I only managed to find this extra space, moving away from the city, five
  minutes from the university, but a lot of people say that we live far away. From the height the person has the car, the

  person moves easily to the city center. But, I mean, there was never that style of
  coffee life, not even in Lourenço Marques, none of us had that coffee lifestyle, so it didn't hurt us to stay away from cafes.
  The nightlife? We were never interested in nightlife, so going to clubs never interested us.




  Our relationship with the city is to go to the center when we have to shop, go for a walk and unfortunately this
  city does not have the conditions for a person to enjoy walking around the city.
  For example, I see a person who wants to take a walk around the city, what? Via Central Avenue, 200 meters, 300
  meters, nothing more. For example, in Manchester we lived on the outskirts of the city, about eight or ten kilometers - it was
  on the outskirts of the center, where we lived until the city center was just housing estates, it was outskirts but it was all
  the big city of Manchester - in each of these surroundings there were parks. City Park was one of the parks.

  Each of the parks was the same large park, which took at least half an hour to cross on foot from one end of the park to the
  other. Parks with lakes, with large expanses of green, with areas, with corners, with trees, that is to say, it is an area
  that is pleasant to walk around. Here in Braga
Machine Translated by Google
  There are no places where we can enjoy walking. There is Bom Jesus, but I mean, Bom Jesus has
  a lot of ups and downs and is relatively small and compact. In Portugal there is no this habit, this
  tradition.


  At the time, when I came to Braga I wasn't so worried about the history of walking because in
  Lourenço Marques, people could walk down the street, it was different. I felt this shock of getting
  there and seeing that at night it was dangerous to walk on the streets, and I wasn't used to that. I
  had just finished dinner and was going for a walk, it was pleasant, I couldn't do that there, but
  then I discovered that there were lots of big parks. In any land there is Hith Parque, which is a
  very large park. Crossing Hith Parque, from one end to the other, is more than half an hour on foot,
  that is very big. In any city there are parks of this size.


  In Manchester, as far as I remember, there were at least five or six of these large parks. Near our
  house, ten minutes walk, we had one of those huge parks that don't exist here. Even by
  rest of Europe, for example, we take holidays in Spain, there are the marginals. It is pleasant to walk along the promenade, it is
  well looked after, has good conditions, palm trees and nighttime activities.




  It's good to go for a walk after dinner or during the day or whatever, but here in Portugal it's difficult.
  So, we can go to Esposende, there's that straight, it's also nice, but there aren't many places like
  that. Esposende we can say is an exception. People go anywhere else, they are small, they are
  compact.


  Here in Braga you cannot live outdoors. In this aspect, I don't identify much with this city we
  have here. For example, I am much more pleased with what is happening in Aveiro, with the stories
  about the "bugs", Aveiro is also flat, but that means there is a much greater incentive to live outdoors,
  areas reserved for pedestrians . Braga, in this aspect, is still a delay in life. Braga is a car-oriented
  city.


  ## Family time ##




  I no longer know what a typical day is like, all these years ago with this story about the IT Center.


  My typical day is very different from the typical day of most teachers. In the last fifteen years that
  I have been here at the IT Center, I have arranged my normal work office. Which means I come
  here every day in the morning, usually at 8:30 am/9 am, depending on what time the kids arrive.
  Since we live outside the city, we always drive the kids here, and they usually have classes at 8:30
  am/9 am. So I'm always here before 9am.


  Generally speaking, I start sending emails in the morning and then it depends on whether I have
  classes to prepare, whether I have documents to produce, whether I have papers to study. Then I
  spend the day here, I often have lunch here. It was a habit I brought from England, having a light lunch,
  sandwich lunch in order to go home early and have an early dinner. Systematically between 6:30
  am and 7 am I am at home and our dinner time is at 7 am, which is not typical Portuguese, but it
  has the advantage that by eating less at lunch I can work in the afternoon. If
Machine Translated by Google
  I have a knife and fork lunch, so I sit down after lunch, it makes me feel a little warm and I fall asleep. And I have the habit
  and advantage of going home early, to spend more time with my family. This means that I was supposed to work seven
  hours a day as a civil servant, but I never did. Arriving here at 9 am and leaving at 6 pm, that corresponds to nine hours, I
  don't take the two hour lunch break.




  Life as a university professor is hard, but perhaps the main culprit is us and not whoever wrote the legislation because we
  are concerned about producing anything in terms of research work and producing results for the sake of our career.




  The career is extremely tough, it's one of those careers that either the person does and is systematically presenting
  evidence of what they do in order to move up, it's not like Secondary Education, which is much simpler. Or, if the
  person doesn't move and doesn't do it, they won't advance in their career. "Wanting to advance" often means working
  beyond what is normal.



  In my case, specifically, I don't work at home at night, I can't, I fall asleep. If I pick up any work book I fall asleep. I created
  this habit from a very early age of not having working conditions at home, otherwise the house would be too much work.
  In the first months that we were at university, we took work home and had work at home and we saw that this was
  affecting our relationship as a family, so from that point on we gave up. There is no room at home, there are no shelves
  with study books at home. I have nothing at home, everything is here. What goes

  It goes home in the folder, the exams to correct, if I need to prepare for a class, the book goes in the folder, but I don't
  have any work book at home.



  ## Children's happiness ##




  Life tended towards greater stability from the moment we found this old house, restored it and had the children, which
  increased stability. Perhaps the result of the fact that my wife, as the daughter of a soldier, spent her childhood moving
  from place to place and that left an impression on her. She has no reference to her childhood, to what the family home is
  like. I have one or two houses, where I lived in Lourenço Marques, and then I have a reference to my parents' house,
  because I lived in each of the houses for many years. And how she felt that, her parents were either on one side or on the
  other, she feels that gap. We were both concerned about ensuring that our children had a reference, which is why we had an
  investment. It cost us a lot, it was difficult for us to restore this house and we wanted to do it as soon as possible. And we
  actually managed to get the house ready when the youngest daughter was a few months old. That's why the youngest
  daughter doesn't even know what the old house is. She happens to know that this is where her grandparents, who stayed
  with her, are currently staying, but she has never seen our old house. She has a reference point, her home throughout her
  childhood and youth has always been this. We've been in that house for 15 years. There is already this stability and
  we would like to maintain this stability. Having conditions even in terms of having a calmer life for retirement, there are
  conditions there.




  There won't be any changes. I don't foresee any major changes, since what was most critical, the most critical phases of our
  lives, have passed, now we can start to relax. We could also
  think "Now that the children are older, they already have their independence, it's time for us to be able to walk
  walking more outside". But for us, walking is a pleasure together.
Machine Translated by Google

  Therefore, even now, I have to escape the history of conferences abroad, I have lost the desire.
  When I was younger I liked going to conferences. My wife went with me, she often went too
  to her conferences. He was the only male companion. The visit program was entirely aimed at women, and I was
  the only man among all the women. The last few times there was another man, an Argentine, there were two of us, the
  two Albertos, who visited various things in Cairo and Egypt. While the women worked, we were having fun.




  Life will now, in fact, be more stable. The question now is "What will the children's future be like? What will it be like or
  not?" Since our life until now has been centered around them. Now
  little by little we will have to realize that they are going to leave and we absolutely do not want them
  to secure. We have a lot of respect there because we feel firsthand what a father's attitude is when he wants to arrest a
  child. That's why it felt good to be in England, away from my parents, with our independent life, not here. Today I call
  every week, if we are far away it makes our senses worse and when we are close we have to call almost every day.




  Far away is different, it's the advantage and we wanted to see if we didn't do that to our children. Anyway, we're going to
  have to start thinking about what life as a couple will be like again. We haven't started thinking yet.
  We have at least five years to finish the course and then eventually leave home and then we start to think about life as a
  three and then possibly as a couple. But for now, what is important is that they feel good when they are with us, but
  at the same time they feel that there is a need for them to create their own structure, their family cell and that they are
  happy with that.
  This I think is the most important thing.

   Interview with Aníbal Augusto Alves




  My name is Aníbal Augusto Alves. I was born on July 10, 1940 in Pinhal do Norte - Carrazeda d'Ansiães, Alto Douro. My
  father is José Secundino Alves and my mother is Célia Rosa do Vale. I have two other brothers: one older than me and
  one younger.




  My paternal grandparents were called Benigno Alves and Maria da Luz Neto, and my maternal grandparents were José
  Luís do Vale and Branca Augusto Figueiredo. The Neto family originates from my maternal grandmother. Alves de Benigno
  is from Galicia, from Ourense, a village in Ourense. My maternal grandfather Vale is from the village of Pinhal, from the
  traditional Vale family. And I know my maternal grandmother isn't from there.



  My maternal great-grandfather is Daniel Figueiredo and comes from Trancoso, Beira. A part of my grandparents
  It is indigenous, from the village of Pinhal do Norte, from traditional families. The branch that comes from abroad is
  that of my great-grandfather Daniel, who comes from Beira. It is easy to imagine that it is of Jewish origin, with the name
  Daniel and profession as a tailor, and given the internal emigration of Jews, Christians new to Beiras, it is likely that it is
  of Jewish heritage. This is clearly from my paternal grandfather.
  family from Ourense.



  My father was a farmer, a farmer in two ways, that is, on his own plots, which he grew, and in the work he did for others,
  namely the work of overseer. My father did all types of agricultural work in Alto Douro, Carrazeda d'Ansiães, from pruning
  vineyards, pruning trees, mowing and all aspects of working with the fields, from working with
Machine Translated by Google
  flowers, I did all these types of activities.



  My father passed away five years ago, it is clear that the memory, the image, is traced back to a long life,
  but since always, and still today, he has a very strong image, of a person of great competence, being minimally literate,
  because he only had some education outside of normal school. He was a person of great intelligence, in the sense of
  understanding the world well, ordering his life and preparing the lives of his family so that they could dominate his life and
  lead it with freedom and responsibility.




  He was a physically strong man. He had a reputation in the village for doing all the work typical of a rural worker with
  great perfection and also for running his own house, although with very limited means.




  My mother was a domestic worker, she didn't work. The memory of my mother and the idea was that she was a person of
  great affability and enormous dedication. My mother appeared less in public things. I didn't have the preponderance of
  my father in common life, village life, public things, church, parties. But she was an extremely delicate person, very accepted
  in ordinary life, very admired, very affectionate with the boys, with her children, with great dedication to my father and
  above all loving, an extreme amount of affection. Always very vigilant about things around the house, she did everything
  from food, but above all to providing our own clothes, which she did when it came to underwear: shirts, pajamas, long
  johns, underwear, all of that she did. Evidently

  who didn't make pants and coats, but she made the rest. Everything came from her.



  My relationship was more intimate and permanent with my mother. My father was a person who lived away from home a lot,
  on normal days, I'm talking mainly about his childhood and youth. He was the person
  who was given great respect. He had great authority. I had and still have great esteem for both of them, a very trusting
  relationship. But the relationship was more intimate with my mother, who was usually the one who punished. My father
  rarely punished.



  The moments that I remember from my family were meals, especially at night because we were together, there was some
  prayer. The others that stand out in my memory are the return home, especially my father, who was the person who lived
  most abroad. As he was a hunter, it was the scenes of seeing the rabbits or the partridges that he brought, the market
  days when he brought things from the fairs.




  The authority at home was dual, but the maximum authority belonged to my father as a reference, but at home everything
  was arranged and ordered by my mother.



  My relationship with my brothers was within a positive and highly affective relationship.
  There is the relationship with my older brother, therefore, with a difference of four years, a relationship that also went
  through in some way, through a modality of authority, of not admitting the youngest to teenage games, small courtships,
  going out, at parties. There was this way that later, naturally, ended and gave way to a relationship of great cordiality.




  With my younger brother, with whom I am seven years apart, there was a relationship of sponsorship towards him,
  coupled with great affection for being a much younger child.
  The cordiality between us has always remained filled with great longing, because from my
Machine Translated by Google
  7 years we never lived together again.



  My family's great encouragement for the boys, with the small exception of the eldest who started working very early, at the
  age of 11, in agriculture, doing everything on the land, from plowing with oxen, taking care of horses, donkeys, all things,
  was to guide us to study. What
  It was, as one can easily imagine in the 40s, a complete anomaly in the village. Studying beyond primary education
  was an idea that had no use, and my parents, in relation to myself and my younger brother, did everything to encourage
  studying.



  ## "Working the land" ##




  My father was a farmer, a farmer in two ways, that is, on his own plots, which he grew, and in the work he did for others,
  namely the work of overseer. My father did all types of agricultural work in Alto Douro, Carrazeda d'Ansiães, from pruning
  vineyards, pruning trees, mowing and all aspects of working with the fields, from working with flowers, he did all this
  type of activities.

  He was a physically strong man. He had a reputation in the village for doing all the work typical of a rural worker with
  great perfection and also for running his own house, although with very limited means.




  ## Mother's affection ##




  My mother was a domestic worker, she didn't work. The memory of my mother and the idea was that she was a person of
  great affability and enormous dedication. My mother appeared less in public things. I didn't have the preponderance of
  my father in common life, village life, public things, church, parties. But she was an extremely delicate person, very accepted
  in ordinary life, very admired, very affectionate with the boys, with her children, with great dedication to my father and
  above all loving, an extreme amount of affection. Always very vigilant about things around the house, she did everything
  from food, but above all to providing our own clothes, which she did when it came to underwear: shirts, pajamas, long
  johns, underwear, all of that she did. Evidently

  who didn't make pants and coats, but she made the rest. Everything came from her.



  My relationship was more intimate and permanent with my mother. My father was a person who lived away from home a lot,
  on normal days, I'm talking mainly about his childhood and youth. He was the person
  who was given great respect. He had great authority. I had and have a great
Machine Translated by Google
 esteem for both, a very strong relationship of trust. But the relationship was more intimate with my mother, who was
 usually the one who punished. My father rarely punished.




  In my childhood, I lived in several houses. My parents didn't have their own house, they lived in family homes. The house
  that I remember because I was also told that I was born in it, was a house in the center of the village, belonging to my
  great-grandfather Daniel. It was a single-storey house, ground floor, although with a part of the upper floor made of wood
  and the part on the side, as was traditional, made of stone. A small house with two sleeping compartments, a living
  room that continued into one of the bedrooms and the kitchen
  connected to a backyard, as was traditional in the villages of Pinhal Novo.



  I then remember the other houses: my maternal grandparents' house, where we lived and which was later inherited from
  my maternal grandfather. In my grandfather's house we always lived together until I was 7 years old, when we left the
  village and dispersed.




  The childhood routine until going to school and the memories I have are of being present in family life, taking care of the
  younger siblings. These are very vivid memories, and a lifetime of little messages from my parents to my
  grandparents, and village games.



  Life at home was very short because the houses were small and had few amenities, so much of the day's life was spent
  on the street, running errands at rustic properties.
  near the village. I remember that sometimes I went to bring lunch to my father or to the workers who were carrying out
  activities that belonged to our house or those that my father took care of.
  And that was it, between games and small errands, that was how it went from my childhood until I was 7 years old.




  As a child, I lived with my parents, both in the village and when we immigrated to Alto Douro: my father, my mother and all
  the boys. From the age of 7, my older brother stayed in the village to continue his primary education. In Pinhal we had a
  great relationship with my maternal grandparents, but in our house it was just us. In Douro, in Alto Douro, my
  father was a caretaker, ran a large farm and my mother had permanent help from a maid.




  I was a child with very open eyes, although small, as a child. Different representations appear to me from
  early childhood, therefore, until I was 4 years old, which was the first time I
  I left the village to go to Porto. Spending time in Alto Douro is also a very strong experience, a year in great isolation, under
  enormous dedication to my mother's work, a more
   abroad, until the experience in Porto, as a boy at boarding school. But I was always a child of eyes
  very open, surprised by the realities, by the changes, by the variation of the world, from the Alto Douro to the city of Porto,
  to the trams. And I also find myself a little influenced by the few
  photographs that exist from the time.



  He was a boy with some shyness, but he immediately made efforts to ensure that he could be accepted by others. A well-
  built, chubby and playful boy, with some discipline difficulties, but without being particularly problematic.
Machine Translated by Google

  The relationship with the other boys was good, with camaraderie, fun, mutual help, especially I remember the more
  conscious times, like Porto, at boarding school. It was a cordial relationship.




  In Pinhal, in my village, the games were generally games of movement, of making homemade motorbikes, of pawns also
  made by my grandfather, many of which took place among the children we were, boys and girls, of hiding, of pretend
  robberies. .



  In Porto, the games became more orderly and took place mainly between the movements of more traditional and simple
  games such as racing, barbell, the old barre game, and naturally also the game of football. The ball was perhaps the game
  in which I participated most, with my Porto colleagues.
  But also the distractions of challenges, of stories, of who told the stories best. Since it was a boarding school, and one of
  the situations was to entertain the children among themselves, with long evenings of stories, of which I have a great
  memory, because among other things I was champion, I think I inherited that from my maternal grandfather and my father ,
  who were great storytellers.

  ## Rural boy ##




  I started school when I was 8 years old. I spent 7 years in Alto Douro, on the farm, a farm completely isolated from
  civilization and everything. Then I returned to my village to my grandparents' house, to do the first year of primary
  education. And from that year on I went to Porto, I was sent by my parents to a small school run by D. Maria José Pestana
  - a famous lady from the Porto bourgeoisie - and there I completed my primary education.




  My strongest memory of school is perhaps entering second grade at my boarding school, in Porto, because I felt a huge
  difference in my preparation, in my way of speaking in relation to boys from a more urban background in the city of Porto.
  This implied a forced adaptation to try to amend my languages, with provincialisms that are practically disappearing
  today. This is a very strong idea, and then I have others.
Machine Translated by Google



  Generally speaking, the education I received was positive. The strongest characteristic is
  perhaps the immense affection I received from my parents and my maternal grandparents. My
  mother's connection with them was extremely strong. This is the strongest characteristic of my
  education, very affective, also very focused on duty, on the example of traditional values such as
  honor, respect for others and the extreme value of the family unit, of one for all, so to speak.


  I think it greatly influenced my way of being emotional. Even today, one of the values that seems
  to structure my way of being is a great availability and a great openness to other people, in the
  dimension of esteem, respect and mutual help. I certainly got that from my parents.


  In the village I went to primary school, which was in an old chapel, in the center of the village. In
  that very cold village, with very cold winters, I was carrying a burlap bag made by my own
  grandmother, like the other children. Then we waited for the teacher to arrive, who came from a
  neighboring village. At school it was the disciplinary life of a boarding school, between the
  classroom, the cafeteria, the recesses and the dormitories. It was a peaceful life.


  I did my primary education in Porto, with some acceptance. I was an esteemed student to the point
  that the owner of the school, the illustrious D. Maria José Pestana, sponsored me, to pay me
  and motivate me to continue my studies at the Jesuit Fathers' Seminary. And therefore, I
  continued my minor studies at the Jesuit Seminary with a brief two-year stay at Soutelo, later
  returning to the center of the Jesuit Minor Seminary, which was in Macieira de Câmara. And from
  then on, from the five years of general formation, which at the time corresponded to the five
  years of high school, I moved on to the formation of the Society of Jesus itself, having entered the
  novitiate in 1957. And then I continued the path of formation throughout the Society of Jesus, which is a lo


  My idea of becoming a priest came very early, certainly due to the influence of the school, also from
  my maternal grandmother who was a person very dedicated to the church, to the ceremonies
  and I helped with the preparation of the catechesis. And at the school in Porto, D. Maria José
  influenced my desire to be a priest, like those priests I met, at that time, who were the Jesuit Fathers.
  This was a very strong ideal since I was 11 years old, which would end up becoming a firm idea, which late
  my going to the seminary, and so on, until the formation of the Society of Jesus continued.


  Leaving my parents' house for school was a very violent departure. There is a characteristic that is
  this, when I left home with my parents, I never had any kind of problem. This has to do with the
  poverty of the houses, they were houses that I personally wasn't extremely attached to, since when
  we moved, everything changed, from the beds to the kitchen utensils. How did it all come together
  I maintained that the clothes were neither rich nor long-lasting, moving house never caused me any
  problems. But leaving my parents' home was enormous, extremely violent violence. I am still
  aware today that when I left for Porto, for boarding school, for a safe month, I cried every day. I even
  ran away, and with the evidence of the impossibility of going any further, I returned to school, after 3
  hours, after eating the chestnuts I was carrying. Therefore, this was a great difficulty from an
  emotional point of view, which in fact was
  I would repeat it in one way or another every time I left home until I left for the Company's novitiate.




  I had chosen the life of the priesthood in the Society of Jesus, and therefore, there is a phase in my life
Machine Translated by Google
 in which all the pretensions of the usual courtships, of the usual attractions between all the boys and girls, which I
 also felt, were avoided, in the sense of controlling and guiding myself, saying:- "I chose another life, I'm going
 to dedicate myself those objectives that were those of the great missionaries." Which means that during the
 several years in which I lived the ideal of the Jesuit Father with great dedication and enthusiasm, I did not admit
 the prospect of dating.



  It turns out that in my psychological and cultural evolution, in the life of the Company, which lasted until I was
  over 25 years old, an internal, personal problem arose, concerning the consistency of my own life within religious
  life. From then on, I negotiated and dealt with this problem at length, with my
  friends, great Jesuit friends, whether superiors or companions, until the decision to leave, to separate myself from
  the Society of Jesus. Well, from then on I was open.



  Now, precisely one of the girls that I knew, that I had met before, came back to me, we met again, we declared
  ourselves again and at that time she appeared, after some other meetings, once I was free from the Company, I fully
  accepted the hypothesis of dating and marriage. Once the possibility of dating was admitted, our marriage was planned.
  So, at that time, a relationship of approximation, hesitation, and conversion, so to speak, developed between me
  and my current wife. I say this because our relationship had some

  difficulties. I myself had some hesitation about making a permanent commitment, so it was on and off, because I was
  living abroad at the time. Fortunately, from a key moment, we both decided to start a consistent love. And shortly
  afterwards we set off to have our wedding, which took a little longer than we wanted, but after two years of
  our relationship, we got married, therefore while we were still living in Belgium.




  I currently have 2 children. The dating phase for me started in my 30s, and then it took some time. So, our marriage only
  took place at the end of my 34th birthday, although we had a very long vision. So the children also came a little later.




  ## "The city where the train ended" ##




  I arrived in Braga in 1976, to come to the university because I had already passed through Braga at Easter, at the
  invitation of Professor Lima de Carvalho, who was then starting to organize the unit
  of Social Sciences at the University of Minho. I arrived in Braga in November 1976.



  I already knew Braga, and it was a city I never thought about working. From my training in Philosophy, at the Faculty of
  Philosophy of the Catholic University, I thought I would never work in Braga again. Therefore, my impression of
  Braga was on the one hand familiar, on the other hand, with
  the feeling that it was a city very cut off from the rest of the world. To paraphrase my wife, "The city where the train
  ended." Okay, that was an impression.



  The first time reminds me of arriving in Braga, by truck. Where the Santa Cruz Shopping Center is located today,
  was the António Magalhães company's bus station. It's a fading memory, with the disgust of the smell of diesel,
  which I was always averse to as a child, of the
  Trás-os-Montes cradles oblivious to these smells.

  From the recent period, from 76 onwards, my memory is of the Rectory, where I was received in an extraordinarily friendly
  manner by the then Rector of the University of Minho, the late Professor Carlos Brandão.




  On the other hand, the challenge from the University of Minho pleased me, because it was, in some way, the most optimistic
  and frank invitation, in the situation I was in, not wanting to live in Belgium anymore, and not yet having a contract in
  Portugal. . Although there were other appeals, they were not as confirmed as Braga's seemed to me.




  In 1976 it was a year of great difficulty in finding accommodation in Braga, so I couldn't stay in Braga right away. I lived
  for some time at a friend's house in Santo Tirso, and, since my wife was able to join me in Braga, we went to live at the Hotel
  Turismo. Then we found, with difficulty, an apartment in Praça Condesável, parish of Maximinos, where we lived for
  15 years, more or less.




  I lived in Lisbon, I lived in Santo Tirso, once I was a teacher and prefect at Colégio das Caldinhas da Companhia de
  Jesus. I lived in the city of Louvain in Belgium, and in Waterloo south of Brussels.




  ## University teacher ##




  There are two conditions that helped me decide which course I wanted to teach.



  The first was formation in the Society of Jesus. A very in-depth training and combined with training generally
  required of Jesuits, which was training in Philosophy.
  The Degree in Philosophy, which I did, was part of the curriculum. I embraced Philosophy with great pleasure, with great
  interest. It was a degree that I completed with some brilliance, with ease, with enthusiasm, because I was lucky enough to
  have excellent professors, remarkable people from an intellectual, cultural and human point of view. When I completed
  this degree I was 25 years old.



  The second was the degree I also completed in Social Communication. This has to do with some of the choices that I myself
  made in Philosophy, and which have to do with the currents of phenomenology, with existentialism, from which the theme
  of communication, affective communication, interpersonal communication, group communication, emerged.
  communication through art, with a great interest in cinema, in the representation of behaviors in cinema. And this led me,
  with the approval and advice of my teachers at the Society of Jesus, to opt for in-depth training in the field of communication.
  And that's what led me to do my degree in Social Communication at the age of 32, in Louvain, after having hesitated about
  doing it in Paris and Milan.




  After finishing my degree, I did some assistant work in the field of group communication, in the field of communication through
  influence, for personality development. These were topics that interested me a lot, in Psychoanalysis and in my own training
  in Analysis. Having done my own analysis in the 70s and 75s, 74/75, and at that time I headed towards my doctorate.




  The first job was after finishing my degree in Philosophy. I was a teacher for three years,
Machine Translated by Google
  Portuguese teacher, Drawing teacher, with great difficulty, since my ability in drawing was, and is, very low. But in
  that mission framework, which was still that of a scholastic Jesuit, therefore, who will have an experience of teaching
  and encouraging young people, which I did at the Caldinhas school, being a Portuguese teacher, it was a very violent
  experience.



  In Lisbon I did some work, also as a teacher, at the Colégio de S. João de Brito, but partially, since at that time I completed
  the first two years of the Theology course.



  The teaching job was more of an imposition, since out of the possible choices I preferred this one. I preferred teaching,
  which I had and still have some inclination for, not the location. The location was not my choice. The location was a firm
  invitation for internal guidance to academic superiors.



  I really like what I do, especially as a teacher, and I don't like much of what I do, in terms of academic management,
  which I have been very busy with in the years I have been at the University of Minho.




  My preference is, in fact, focused on the work of training, developing people, let's say there is a hidden vocation, which
  would be Psychologist.



  I entered the University of Minho in 1976. My contract date is November 12th, although I started earlier, in the preparation of
  subjects. On my first day of work I prepared the Cultural Anthropology and Sociology I lesson, at the Hotel Turismo, in
  a studio at the hotel. At that time, the top floor
  of the hotel was made up of small studios, with kitchenette. I remember preparing the first course of
  Cultural Anthropology and Sociology I, Communication and Agent of Socialization, at the time, the History and Social
  Sciences course was founded. A Degree that would have to have a short duration, as the evolution
  the Portuguese political situation, the university itself had to be very agitated in those years and in the following. So, this
  course ended because the Secondary Education reform suppressed the subjects of Sociology and Introduction to
  Social Sciences, which were present in the curriculum at that time, and therefore, teacher training in this area expired.
  So, first I exercised the
  my teaching in this course, also as an option, but always subjects linked to Social Psychology, Sociology,
  Communication. Then I switched to Engineering courses in 77, and from that year onwards,
  for the International Cultural Relations course, at that time it was still all together. It was the course I worked on the most in
  my first years at university.



  ## University matrix model ##




  In 1976 there were a maximum of 60 students per class. The university had a very small number of students. The university
  was very small. I must say that the number of students would be 2000 in total. The courses focused on teacher training,
  engineering and one exception was International Relations. Teachers remained at 300 for a long time.




  The University of Minho started with an ideal, which was to invest in new training. In fact, it was a note present at the time,
  for new universities, they could not be repetitive compared to classical universities. And the University of Minho
  launched the Engineers and Teachers project, where, in my opinion, as an exception, the International Relations
  course was enrolled.
Machine Translated by Google



  The first classes were given in the D. Pedro V building, the amphitheaters, the largest, could not
  accommodate more than 60 people, in fact they were called that, they were "60A", "60B", "60C".
  The other rooms were small and shallow rooms, which could fit 48 students. At that time there was a
  fashion for not having platforms for the teacher. When the rooms were small this was tolerated well,
  when the rooms were wider it was more difficult because, especially for small people like me, you couldn't s
  students.


  The teaching materials that existed at the time were sufficient. At least for me. In any case, I was never
  very specialized, nor convinced of audiovisual pedagogical techniques. But at that time there was
  already the possibility of designing acetates, which were very useful, especially for diagrams. I
  never used transparencies much for texts. My classes were mainly focused on
   oral communication, in dialogue with students, as they still are today, and polycopying, at that time,
  already possible.


  What we were very lacking in were texts for students to read. The library was very poor, it was still
  in full strength. But I must remember that there was always a notable effort, on the part of those
  responsible, to multiply bibliographical sources for students. And also, given the certain intimacy
  that existed with the students, the teachers' own books, my books for example, were passed on to
  the students, in short, there was reasonable support.


  On the other hand, it is clear that the spaces were very narrow. In those last years of the 70s, in the
  corridor on the lower floor, which was a kind of basement, which faced the Gulbenkian
  Foundation, I remember having to carry my briefcase over my shoulder, at the risk of of not getting
  through the tightness of the corridor. Those were difficult times, not without me thinking what a
  disaster it would be in this basement, because the students were very crowded.


  But I must say that there was a good atmosphere, an interesting time, which was still very fresh
  from the April Revolution, and therefore, we had very heated students in the debates in the
  pedagogical councils. It's a time that I have fond memories of.


  In Social Sciences, the teachers were a group of a dozen, no more. The Social Sciences
  teachers' offices were on the 3rd floor of D. Pedro V, where there was a kitchen, half the living room
  of this double apartment, and then we had three internal and two external offices. There were five
  offices for all teachers.


  Since we had D. Pedro V's office, I normally came to the university every day.
  Part of it was studying, reading, preparing photocopies for students, preparing texts and classes.
  I had classes three/four days a week, because I had to teach more than one subject. And from an
  early age I gave part of the Committees, both the Pedagogical Committee of the International
  Relations course, to which I was linked from a very early age, and the Scientific Pedagogical Unit of
  Social Sciences. My time was divided quite well between studying, classes and preparing
  materials.


  Unfortunately, some of the colleagues at that time followed other guidelines. I must also say that 24
  years have put us at a distance from that time. There was a group around Professor Armindo Carvalho's
  initiative, which was very interesting. A diverse group, but one that did not reach
Machine Translated by Google
  cement yourself. I say this with some regret, because as it brought together a series of notable people, who
  unfortunately were unable to build the plan that was outlined, were unable to put it into practice. Perhaps due to the
  short-term decline in the importance of Social Sciences at that time in
  Portuguese university, therefore at the University of Minho.



  But regarding colleagues, I still have one or two colleagues who came two/three years later, within the scope of History.
  But unfortunately, when it comes to Anthropology, for example, my colleagues at that time, Professor Armindo Carvalho,
  Dr. Alice Geral, Dr. Palaná, have already left teaching, or left altogether, or left at the University of Minho. .




  At the University of Minho over these 24 years, in my opinion, there have been major changes. In any case, there is a scheme
  that has been maintained at the University of Minho, which is the so-called "matrix model", which is a kind of ideal type that
  inspired the organization of the university. A model that had very positive effects, I believe, during the launch and
  creation phase of the university, of which I would not say the same today.




  In terms of changes, one of the changes that is closest to me was the evolution of Social Sciences itself. Social
  Sciences grew until the beginning of the 80s. In order to develop a Social Sciences course at the University of
  Minho, there was an inversion, so to speak, in the programming of Secondary Education, returning in force to History and
  reducing that exit, from the revolution in the importance of Social Sciences, Sociology, Economics, Anthropology.

  This caused the Social Sciences section to regress, in such a way that the Social Sciences Unit grew in the 1980s, to the
  detriment of previous disciplines. Social Sciences grew more
  for History. This Social Sciences Unit, however, would give way to at least two others, namely: the division of Social Sciences
  into Economics, Management and Law, which became autonomous into another Unit and the current School of Economics
  and Management . This was an important, structural change with regard to Social Sciences.




  This change did not affect my personal work, but it affected the development of what can be considered the academic,
  teaching and research set in the regions. I am convinced that it affected us, with advantages and disadvantages, but it
  affected us greatly.



  I understand that the set of Social Sciences should have been kept together, so that Economics itself, and then even more,
  Management, International Relations, Political Science, and I would almost say Law, should have remained in the search
  for a comprehensive and unifying paradigm, of the study, of the object, of what I consider to be the Social Sciences.




  I have an image that I am a person with good relationships. I think I have this as a testimony from colleagues, students,
  employees, that I have had over all these years, generally a very pleasant, positive relationship, with no shortage
  of shadows or shadows. But the dominant one is good relationships, and I continue to hold this dimension highly.




  I have funny stories at university, from the documentation, to my lack of attention, I don't know!!
  At the beginning I was very interested in being a young teacher, and there is a student who, after I announced the scheduling
  of work and the deadlines for submitting projects, comes to me, at the teacher's table and asks me:- "But then Mr.
  teacher, what do I do when my time comes?", "When the time comes, present your work.", "Not teacher, but my time..."
  And then at that time there is a colleague who says to me:- "Mr. Doctor, have you taken a good look at her?" The lady was
Machine Translated by Google
  pregnant. These are my mistakes.



  In terms of funny stories, I have some with the students. That student of mine who I gave 15 points on the final test. At that
  time, the final exams did not immediately give final grades, and I published the grades, but I had a warning to students who
  were not satisfied with the grade, because at that time there were few students, I must say that this is all very possible
  when there are a group of 50 students. And then there's a student who comes to see me and says:- "Mr. Doctor, I wasn't
  happy with my grade!" We went to see her note. "You're not; happy with 15 points?", "No, Mr. Doctor, I think I deserve
  more!" and I said:- "Well, there's a solution, it's to take an oral test and then we'll see. If the girl takes an oral test in
  which she documents that she has mastery of the higher subject, I have no doubts about changing her grade ".




  Therefore, the student wanted to do the oral, and she did the oral. In fact, he gave a very brilliant speech, recognized by
  me and my other colleague. And then I actually had to surrender to the evidence and give him a 17.



  I have lots of stories with my students. I really like students, I keep it good
  image of them and them. It's always a challenge, and if I have any slight shadow of doubt it's from not having been able to
  dedicate more to classes.



  ## Academic experiences ##




  In Social Sciences, the teachers were a group of a dozen, no more. The Social Sciences teachers' offices were
  on the 3rd floor of D. Pedro V, where there was a kitchen, half the living room of this double apartment, and then we had

  ## Days are always the same ##




  I have two types of days: Sundays, festive days and work days. My work day usually starts with leaving home at 8
  am. I usually drop my youngest son off at school and I'm at university around 8:20 am. So how has my fate been to have

  permanent management functions, either the Department or the Course or simultaneously director of the Unit, the School,
  or other instances of the university, generally, if I have a class, I start with the most immediate preparation of the
  class, running the risk of often Eve. Then I teach the class.
  Generally, I combine the class day, which is two days, with assistance to the students themselves who at
   Sometimes I start in the classroom itself. And then I go to the office, to respond to the internal office, this in the
  morning.



  I usually go for lunch at 1 o'clock and take a break due to health conditions. Every few years, I take a break in the middle of
  the day until 3am, unless an order meeting makes me come to the university earlier, which will also lead to a slightly earlier
  lunch.



  In the afternoon I usually try to read, if I don't have academic meetings or office work to do.
Machine Translated by Google
  that require my study. At the university itself I try to read, generally it is some readings in
  order, or they are works that I have to read, student works, assistants' works, theses, or some
  reading of magazines, something that is very poorly considered. I really read a lot regarding
  congresses, proceedings, magazines specializing in communication, especially, but also in
  other areas, in which I am very interested, such as those of a philosophical, ethical nature and,
  in general, social and current affairs. cultural.


  The afternoon is generally spread out. I haven't had afternoon classes for a long time, I try
  not to, meetings are also held in the afternoon. By 7 o'clock I'm usually home for family life.



  ## No time ##



  My leisure hours are very few now, I think they are very short. I really like, for example, going to the
  cinema and I end up going to the cinema very rarely. I really like music and I listen to little
  music. I read very little romance, which is difficult for me. I now have several novels on my shelf, in
  my house, unopened. I have one in the middle and I have the last one, which was already offered
  to me and which I would love to read so much, which is José Saramago's last novel, which I
  haven't even opened. So, my free time is largely dedicated to mandatory reading, that is, reading some do
  to my discipline.


  I try to follow the newspaper and some current magazines. The rest of my free time is dedicated to my family, I
  have this as a point of honor, for example, I really certify the cultural aspect, this cultural aspect that is interesting, which
  is part of interacting with colleagues, with people from the city, which I have almost radically escaped from to be there
  for my children and my wife.




  ## Monitor your children ##




  My concerns are of two types: professional concerns, which are great, and personal concerns.
  The personal concern is related to my children's education. They were born when I was already
  old enough. Typically, children are born earlier because people also get married earlier. In my
  case this did not happen. And so, I'm in my 60s and the youngest son is 15 years old. And my
  biggest concern is that he has the support of his parents to prepare himself.



  Professionally, I am concerned about two aspects: I am concerned about the dispersion with
  which I carry out my role as a teacher, very segregated between the role of teacher, for which
  I have great esteem, and which I have undoubtedly made a reason for living. . I'm worried
  about not being able to unite it, follow it, carry it out in a more satisfactory, more appropriate way,
  especially with regard to studying and meeting students, knowing that classes require some less prepara


  On the other hand, I am also worried about the university. The way the university is conceived
  and regulated also worries me and causes me some sadness. I see in effect that, as far as I and
Machine Translated by Google
  when it comes to a group, we have great difficulties in adapting, creating new ways of stimulating,
  to promote the creative and well-founded training of young people on our courses.


  My concern has fundamental repercussions between the University of Minho as an institution, and
  the course to which I am predominantly linked, which is the Social Communication course. And then
  I try to be with my colleagues, especially in the quality of this course, since it is the project to which
  I am most connected and so are they. But as a whole of the university, I understand that it is a
  highly cumbersome structure, very dependent both on supervision and on its own complexity and
  in which the primary actions, which are Higher Education and also research and service to
  the community, are stuck. . We are able to move with little agility, which is a condition for survival
  in our current world, a world of movement, of too much noise, but in which it is necessary to
  distinguish the most important and be able to articulate the measures and conditions, so that this
  most important go to full realization.




  My biggest wish, at this stage, which I consider to be no longer a farewell, but finally, more peaceful
  academic life, with regard to the professional, is to still be able to provide teaching, to help young
  students with greater vigor, to mature some of my academic convictions, especially those
  regarding the deepening of knowledge and its connection with personal and social life.



  In the professional sphere, what I wanted was to conclude my academic performance with some
  kind of destiny that had vigor, in the sense of being a well-founded path to knowledge, with a
  very marked characteristic, especially of knowledge always being a path that can be perfected.
  And combine this knowledge with the vigor of your maturation and personal and social interest.


  The other big wish is that my children can actually enjoy the support of their parents during their
  formative years.

   # Interview with António de Mota Gonçalves




  My name is António de Mota Gonçalves. I was born on September 30, 1947, in the parish of
  Caires, municipality of Amares, district of Braga. I have two brothers and a sister.




  I lived with my nuclear family, my parents and my brothers. My father was a so-called "artist" of works. In the 50s he had a
  lot of people. It was him and a brother, then the brother emigrated and the two ended up.




  There were work fronts involving a lot of people and a lot of works, stills and large swimming
  pools. Therefore, strictly speaking, he only did this. On the contrary, my mother performed a series
  of domestic tasks and brought my father the food at midday. It covered five/six kilometers and
  then returned.
Machine Translated by Google



  As I was the oldest, I also did this task many times. I spent two/three hours to take food and then returned.
  Afterwards, my mother, in addition to domestic work, helped my grandparents with agriculture.




  My father was the person with authority at home. At that time it was patriarchal. Respect was all his. However,
  my father had an excellent background, he was authoritarian but he was excellent. It was that person, for
  example, a persimmon farmer gave two persimmons and he didn't eat anything without cutting a little for
  everyone, it was sacred. He was very human, very honest, too honest. I have the impression that he was too
  honest in his experience, prompt, but rigorous and very disciplinary.


  I think that respect, that notion of authority that my father had, still remained from childhood.
  Whether we like it or not, there is always a little difference in it.


  My mother was already like that, more of a troublemaker, but my father was there as an authority,
  ready, I mean he played her role, but in a subordination. We were her escape, if she had problems, we were
  the escape.


  With my grandparents, I only maintained strong contact with my maternal grandparents. I met my maternal
  grandmother, shortly before she died, I must have been around four years old.


  I am the oldest of the brothers. I'm four years apart from my sister, then I'm a boy four years apart. As I was the
  oldest, I was the "big boss" of the place, that is, I imposed myself and when I wasn't doing well I was doing
  badly. But I got along very well with my brothers.


  The relationship between us was better than it is now. Nowadays we don't stray from what is usual.
  Society has become individualistic and today we form this individualism, previously we did not.


  As I left home when I was 10, I later came to visit. The relationship we had was that of children, that playful
  dispute. Sometimes I imposed my authority, as I was the oldest. If it was any kind of joke, I would have to
  win and sometimes I would order certain things to be done and they didn't want to, but I imposed myself.
  There were four years of difference.


  Before the 25th of April, my father and I, as the eldest son, at the end of mass, my uncles and uncles would
  all go over, we would socialize. With the 25th of April, one went to party A, the other went to party B and we entered in
  individualism. Currently, we get along well but coldly. In the past there was solidarity in everything, even in
  misery. After the 25th of April, individualism was noted.




  My childhood was funny, obviously it can't be compared to today. Today there has been a certain evolution in
  society. But childhood was funny. we were free, totally free.


  I am still from the time of transitional civilization, when there were ox carts, there were no cars, no
Machine Translated by Google
  There were roads, and I saw what it could have been like a few centuries ago, but nowadays no one
  can make that comparison. So I am privileged. I'm from a transition civilization.


  My area was a completely rural area and, therefore, I have in my memory a past that I think is enriching,
  regardless of whether it was what it was at that time, but what it would be like there would be in any other
  country, it was the time itself.


  When I was 5 years old, we didn't have today's concept of protection, we had to perform any task. Sometimes we even had
  to do the cooking, cook the beans, all that stuff, I mean we were ordered.




  The house we lived in was humble, it was what we went to any house and saw, the simple bed, the
  clothes. At the time, it was a mattress made from corn puffs, when it wasn't corn it was rye. I think the
  pillow was also made of rye, the dresser was a simple thing that was bought at markets, the kitchen.
  I'm still from the clay phase, which then passed into iron and is now gas, but I'm still from the clay
  and iron phase. It was a very rudimentary house, that is, there were no major investments.



  I remember that if I went to a store or a grocery store there would be a dozen items. There being
  a grocery store in my parish and within a radius of seven or eight kilometers was the same thing. Corn
  here, beans there, grain there. Olive oil was measured in pints and half pints. The small cod,
  'cheap', but ready, was summed up in a dozen items: the wine, the pork, a little ham. It was what was
  lived.


  ## Far from home ##




  I remember that my school was old, I only attended it for a year. In the second year I went to a new
  school. I only have a small memory of it. It was a two-story building, I don't remember what it had on the
  bottom, maybe it was, and the school was on the top floor. There were two rooms. What I keep from her
  is very little, I have a very fleeting light. I remember the games, playing at
  pawn, to play when running away. I remember it's danova.



  In terms of school, I didn't have any major problems, I spent the four years in peace, very well-rounded
  in terms of school. He was a very normal child. I remember more the games where we threw stones at
  each other, those games between the upper places and the lower places. I remember cracking the heads
  of some colleagues and others.


  I left home when I was 10, I completed fourth grade when I was ten. At that time, we were influenced by
  the authoritarian system that existed and we had no decision-making power. I went to a
  boarding school, specifically in Monte Real, where I stayed until I was 13/14 years old.




  The school had very strict rules. I noticed when I went on vacation in August, I resented it, I noticed
Machine Translated by Google
 which then became inhibited. I mean, I was little and I almost hid myself from people to go to
 House. I went to school in Braga for 11 months, then we went to Amares for the holidays, often walking, and I felt
 out of place.



  In relation to my parish I feel uprooted, because I left when I was 10 years old and then went there to visit, on a
  short vacation, I don't have a friendship because I didn't cement it, I always walked around like a gypsy.



  At 14/15 I went to Lisbon to work in the baking industry and at 16 I volunteered for the Navy. I was in Lisbon in
  the information area. At 19 he was already in Guinea and at 22 in Mozambique. It was all very fast.




  My childhood at a cultural level was good, because while I was baking I was enrolled at the Escola Comercial
  de Mil Navarra, in Almada and I was enrolled at the Escola Moderna do Conde Redondo. I almost always had a
  connection to school because I had a strong desire to break down, to evolve and to progress.



  In my growing up process, I wasn't influenced by anyone, although my father, who did his heavy artillery military
  service in Lisbon, talked a lot about that time because it was his great adventure. He left that rural environment for
  military service and talked a lot about military life and the most important thing that could have influenced me was
  my love of military service and that will be reflected later. As he talked a lot about the troop's adventures he influenced
  us a lot and then there was also a factor: I experienced the military war at that stage of adolescence when I was
  12/13 years old, that was what influenced me a lot.



  ## ##




  When I was 16, I volunteered for the Navy and at 17 I was called up. At that time, at 17 years old, I saw life
  somewhat blocked in terms of activity, because at the time no one could escape going to Africa, and I
  I saw the advertisement on television "Follow the Navy", and then I also followed the Navy, and I thought it was funny.



  I followed the normal Navy route, I was there for close to six years, I did a commission in Guinea for 39 months,
  and when I returned, I became available.



  I really enjoyed the period I was in Guinea because I was in a communications center, it was a place in --- (band 2 2m5s)
  where the entire theater of operations passed. We were linked to the maritime defense command, to the general staff.
  Our mission was crypton etelex. We did all the chief command work for the air force, the navy and not the army. It
  was funny because we were aware of all the details, we saw what the counter-information was like. It was
  interesting because we included, we jammed on Conakry radio and saw the lies that were proclaimed,
  that whole theater of operations.




  We had direct contact with the population, although it wasn't a very emotional contact, it was more like that,
  when we went out at night we went to the "tabancas".



  I have an adventure in Guinea, in the neighborhoods of Tombali, called the neighborhoods of Tombali?????
Machine Translated by Google
  We walked with the RTP team, in those Christmas messages, and then in these neighborhoods of Tombali
  there was a big sandy beach and we walked around the cowrie shells. However, a tornado came and it
  became dark and those from RTP were poor, most of them were distressed. We only had one boat because
  the boat was offshore, on patrol and it remained at night. Suddenly a huge rain comes and they are all distressed. T
  However, as a tornado lasts about ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, the tornado passed and we
  returned loaded with buckets of cowrie shells. It was a different day.


  It was a period of war, but the war was largely confined to the borders and certain locations, for example, it
  was called Colmo Island, in the Morés forest. They came and went, and I was in this privileged place,
  we had information and the main strongholds were all abroad, now as Guinea is small they came and went.




  We had a very large contingent of Cubans, we even caught Cubans by hand. They had anti-aircraft guns
  nearby and everything was almost supplied with Cubans, Lebanese, almost a foreign legion
  that came and went, and it was easy for them to carry out operations.


  We, the Navy, were the ones who practically transshipped everything, in terms of communication routes.


  What I liked most about the Navy, I don't know if it will be common, was the camaraderie and the atmosphere
  among people. It was like a family. We were there on the ship for entire weeks.


  ## Retrograde city ##




  Braga appeared again in 1975 when I came from Mozambique.


  Braga was a city without great development, I mean, people arrived here, as I did myself, when I came
  to university I joined Largo do Paço, but I mean it wasn't anything special. Braga was what I already knew
  in general terms, and I almost came to confront
  with a reality already known. There was no shock.


  We came from Lisbon by bus or train and from Porto, something moved me because of the landscape.
  There were there, from Porto upwards, the vineyards, the fields, the people and that already moved, he
  said: - "I'm already in the familiar place."




  I joined the University of Minho in 1979.




  At the time, without being able to prove it, I had completed the fifth year but I lacked documentation, because I took the
Machine Translated by Google
  Guinea a letters section and I took another in Lisbon.


  As I was new, they put me on shift. As I had been in communications in the Navy, I worked a lot on crypton, on
  very advanced machines, I took a Cryptography course and they sent me to do trades and everything.




  They were amazed at the way I wrote, without looking at the machine, because in the Navy we are
  obliged, in krypton terms, to do that. As I wrote well, now it's computers, but back then
  they were machines, I had time for everything. And there was a colleague, Ermelinda, who went
  to Universidade Nova de Lisboa, who was on the Science Courses and I was on two shifts, two
  months or three, around that, and automatically I was on the Science Courses, or whether with
  the University's Engineering Department and the entire working day, plus Physics, Mathematics
  and Biology, I stayed with both sectors.


  Later, a lady called Dona Emília, deceased, came and she took care of the office hours and I
  was left with the Engineering service side.


  I was amazed when I got there, because I saw people practically having no legislation at all and my
  dominant concern was organizing some autonomy. I couldn't imagine having to go and ask Mrs
  Maria Luísa, who was head of the secretariat, everything - "When is this, when is that?", I
  was always in that situation. And then, I, with Sciences and Mrs. Maria José, who is currently
  the secretary of the current university administrator, started organizing our folders and after a
  while we were in complete autonomy.


  I had such an advantage because at the time agendas were written by machine, attendance
  sheets by machine, everything was by machine, as I had a great advantage there, there was an added valu
  inform, to get involved in the legislative part. In a way, I was in the privileged place of
  following, practically on the academic side, the university almost from beginning to end. It
  wasn't from the beginning, because I entered in 1979, but I went through that transition phase from
  the bachelor's degree to the degree, in the transition plans, with all those difficulties of
  attributing equivalences, which helped me a lot, because nowadays the structure of the house There are n


  I adopted a philosophy from the first moment I entered university. As I had some insecurity in
  dealing with it, one of the situations was to do a little marketing and create a product. My initial
  concern was - "How am I going to treat these people? Am I going to treat them like girls?
  Girl?"


 Everyone knows that young people are a bit restless, very confrontational, and when I came I fell
 like a parachute, and then I stood back a bit and thought - "Well, I have to adopt a policy here, a
 philosophy of adaptation ." Then I thought "Young man", it works well for everyone. Even today
 it's "Oh young man", I mean, but that was from the first second I joined, because I had to do
 some marketing. "Young" applies to everything, be it age, male or female, it applies to everything,
 and so I adopted the term "Young" to address the counter.


  Then he went to the public and maintained a linear approach. And therefore, my idea was either
  rich, like poor, like short, like tall, I would always have a supportive behavior and then the fruits come by
  addition. I gave credibility to the product.
Machine Translated by Google



  My objective was to always be informed as much as possible and a lot of information is often obtained without
  being through university channels, sometimes through newspapers and then giving credibility to the product we
  sell. Therefore, from the moment we are right afterwards, the
  credibility comes in addition. And today I am able to sell a lie faster than another
  true. I have always tried to behave truthfully, up to date and knowledgeable.



  I started with Academic Services. In terms of category, I didn't have any major precautions, I worked my way up.
  Regarding the internal issue, there was a phase in which people were divided into two groups: one more pro-students
  and the other anti-students. And I was in the pro-student group. Then I asked the former rector to leave.
  I spent two years at the Secretariat of State and Emigration. Then, when I was supposed to continue at the
  Emigration Support Institute, Complexo I opened in Gualtar, and, finally, I was placed here at Complexo I. I received this
  complex from the civil construction department and have remained there.



  Due to my social stratum, I fought for the place I have, and therefore, I am in this as I could be in anything else. To this
  day it has been a survival. I didn't have the power to choose, I had to accept what the circumstance and situation allowed
  me.



  My task is very comprehensive. When I came to Complex I, it was the only block at the university.
  The Academic Services were still in Largo do Paço. All the university's facilities were spread out, and I took this
  on almost as my own university, my own service, and what I internalized here had to work and I still maintain that
  principle. Of course, I don't have specific boundaries, I have a very comprehensive space that may not even be
  described in any task regulations.




  ## Massification ##




  The university was small, we practically knew the students by name. At that stage we practically didn't miss a mistake,
  an error would come out, we would call, send a postcard, we had that wonderfully because there were very few of them.




  Even today, many of these graduates, of course they are all over the place, still visit us and we are pleased to see that
  they still remember us. It was a family because there were just a few of them. Nowadays things are very
  widespread.




  Before he became an administrator, the academic services were excellent, they worked and I learned a lot
  at this stage.




  At the time, I could have had ten degrees. The colleague next door, with International Relations and the
  Language Course, could have been there with about ten. That's practically
Machine Translated by Google
  In the start-up phase, we should have around twenty degrees by then.


  In principle, before I was there, they told me that there were some classrooms in Largo do Paço, in 1976,
  because we only had students in the classes in 1976. When I entered, all those that were in the
  pedagogical field, Psychology, Micro Teaching was at Abade da Loureira and the bulk of the column was
  at D. Pedro V. Then we had phases here in which we had the Economics areas on Rua do Castelo, and
  we had Mathematics in Pelado, next to São Geraldo, which is no longer there; São Geraldo is the
  Shopping Center of Santa Cruz, but it was a fleeting period, in Santa Cruz it was there for a year or two, then it wa
  extinct.


  Of the changes that have been made at the University of Minho, the positive aspect is the greatness it
  is taking and it is clear that we had very good management in the search for money to invest
  and develop. This is the positive point and I think almost no one denies it. In terms of human resources,
  we never had people who focused on the problem, I think the university is in bad shape, I think the
  Human Resources department does not serve its objectives, because it is limited to salaries and
  ADSE and little else. They do not analyze whether on one side there is a surplus of staff, and in others
  there is a shortage. I consider that the university is very "ha doc" in terms of Human Resources.


  This affects my work because, sometimes, we could have problem-solving and we don't because we
  feel lost without having an authority above us. For example, in my case, I have nothing set up anywhere
  to give information and practically, apart from what I do in some corridors, I have no one to reach out to.
  I've felt self-managed for a long time, which for a service is very bad.




  There is an episode that took place here at university and that gave me a bit of fun. We were still in Largo
  do Paço and an African came, who was on the International Relations Course and asked for a
  qualifications certificate. The person who attended to him was a colleague who had passed away,
  Ms. Aíssa, and she had an incident, but I was nearby, because in the meantime I had been
  working with the public. Initially it was Maria José, but then we had Ms. Aíssa. So he got there and
  asked for a certificate, gave the draft and the colleague made the certificate, with those elements. After
  a day or so, he got there and gave her the certificate and looked very serious at it. The colleague stood
  there silently looking at him. And he neither tied nor untied, nor left the counter.


  The colleague put José on the certificate; Mané, but he wasn't José, he was Fodémané. You see, but he, instead
  say Fodémané, he stood there on the counter. He never left, neither tied nor untied.


  Then he came back nicely and pointed out: - "That's not my name." - "What's the name?" He , it's him
  started spelling, his colleague started laughing and corrected his certificate.


  Afterwards she was very happy about that, because his name was Fodémané and not JoséMané.
  It was funny because we observed all that adventure and the shyness of the African student himself
  in wanting to indicate that his name was Fodémané.


  Another funny episode. There was a student, whose name I don't remember, he was from Mozambique
  and was studying Textile Engineering, he even had a scholarship from Mozambique. He was in
  Covilhã and didn't want a bachelor's degree and came here to the university for a degree, and got a
  degree and it seems common to me to have an average of 14 or 15. And at the time, the first master's degrees op
Machine Translated by Google
 Textile, and he was invited to take the master's degree. At the time, we had a good relationship with the public
 and he asked me, he was already an engineer, and he asked me:-"And now this course, what is it called?", I say I tell
 him - "It's master.", he says:- "Master of works! Hey, hey!". I mean, I found it funny that he didn't accept being a
 master very well.



  ## Twenty degrees ##




  At the time, I could have had ten degrees. The colleague next door, with International Relations and the
  Language Course, could have been there with about ten. Practically at the start-up phase, we should have had around
  twenty degrees.



  ## Dispersion ##




  In principle, before I was there, they told me that there were some classrooms in Largo do Paço, in 1976, because we
  only had students in the classes in 1976. When I entered, all those that were in the pedagogical field, Psychology, Micro
  Teaching was at Abade da Loureira and the bulk of the column was at D. Pedro V. Then we had phases here in which we
  had the Economics areas on Rua do Castelo, and
  we had Mathematics in Pelado, next to São Geraldo, which is no longer there; São Geraldo is the Shopping Center of
  Santa Cruz, but it was a fleeting period, in Santa Cruz it was there for a year or two, then it was
  extinct.



  ## Wait a little ##




  I wanted my children to survive as I do. This is a passage in this world, we have to eat, we have to survive. Now the
  situation, day-to-day life, is what destiny will say, because we cannot pre-destine it. Now, obviously, ultimately, if I
  came to university it would be great. For economic and emotional reasons, I wanted them to come to the University
  of Minho. So far they have given me encouragement for this.




  Personally, the concerns are about health, as is logical, because the health system is terrible.
  Right now the thing that concerns me is the health system, it's not the wars, it's not the peace, it's the health aspect,
  because after a certain moment people are given over to the animals.



  I expect very little from life. Now the dedication is to the daughters, so that they have the best possible in society and
  wait for the years to advance.



  I don't have many projects for the future. Now I'm stabilized, what more do I want? The salary isn't much, but
  it's enough for day-to-day life, if they don't mess with the pensions I'll have more or more
Machine Translated by Google
  reform is less assured. The daughters are healthy like the family in general. Now I just worry about
  In fact, anyway, I don't know how I'll be inside, but in 15 or 20 years I'll be upset about the healthcare system we have...




  ## I like nature ##




  I have my little hobby in primary activity, I really like the primary sector, I understand everything,
  and I dominate the primary sector. I mean, I really like to entertain myself in the primary sector, do some grafting, play with
  things, at the point I have some fruit trees. I like to follow the evolution of nature. All of this breaks my stress and
  gives me joy.



  Otherwise, I arrive at night to meet the family who are already watching soap operas and I take my Macintoch and
  put in my little articles that I have picked up throughout the day or whenever the situation happens.



  ## Calm of everyday life ##




  My day-to-day life is peaceful. I get up in the morning, do my personal hygiene, have breakfast, start distributing
  the clientele to the schools and go to the university.



  At noon I collect, we all have lunch together, I distribute it again and return to the university.



  At 5:30 pm I collect again and go home, then depending on the time of year, for example, at this time the night is almost
  until 8 pm and then between 6 pm and 8 pm I have my little hobbies, or we go shopping or this or that .




  ## Sincerity and honesty ##




  I try to cultivate, although it's a bit difficult these days, sincerity and honesty. Now, sincerity, these days when there is a
  lot of hypocrisy, we can't always maintain sincerity, suddenly we are being fooled. Nowadays we are sincere but
  with a step back.
  There are no more words, there is nothing. Nowadays we can say that we are in a society of boys, of scoundrels, there is
  no word.



  From what I see on a daily basis, starting with the government, it's all a kind of boys' society. We don't have integrity, that's
  a point of view, I could even be wrong, I could be influenced by the way I've evolved over the years, in the environment
  I've been in, but I notice that a lot. There is something here that does not provide security in terms of friendships.
Machine Translated by Google
  There are things I would like to be involved in, anything in the field of sports, but of course, age
  Now I no longer allow everything, but I have become quite selfish too. I mean, it's the thing, nowadays there is no trust in
  others, or if there is, it is limited, we are waiting for the first opportunity.



  I go in line with the old friendship maxim: - "Friendship is an alliance so fine that the slightest clash of interests breaks it."




  My life is being well lived, well enjoyed, I mean, I have nothing to regret.



  My youth had a period that was tremendous, with adventure in Guinea, three years in Mozambique, I was in the
  Navy. I had an experience like riding on a plane, riding on jumbo jets here. I was on submarines, I was on frigates, on
  draglines, I was on patrols, I mean I lived life. Deep down I feel normalized.




  I was in Mozambique, there were many groups even in terms of religion, cultures, we mixed and
  I integrated, I even learned a few things, "smilai", "alativai", that whole doctrine. In cultural and anthropological terms,
  there was an experience that I think was enriching.



  For example, in the case of Guinea, the tradition of the Mandingas, the Valantes, the Fluctos, in Mozambique the Macondes
  there with their teeth cut, ears pierced, beaten, which means this gives wealth to human beings.




  In my generation I enjoyed life, a relative enjoyment but at least in terms of knowledge I think it was enriching.

  Interview with Maria Cecília
   Marado Moreira


  ## "I was born in Braga" ##




  My name is Maria Cecília Branco Marado Moreira. I was born in Braga, on December 16, 1960.



  ## Italian and French ancestry ##




  My father's name is José Moreira and my mother is Irene Branco deAlmeida Marado.



  Regarding my paternal grandparents: my grandmother was called Conceição, although we called her grandmother
  Moreira; My grandfather died when I was very little, around 5 years old. He had a very strange name, I don't know if it was
  Sepriano.



  Regarding my maternal grandparents, my grandmother also died when I was very little,
Machine Translated by Google
 His name was Conceição and my grandfather was called Manuel Carneiro Marado and we called him Grandfather Marado,
  therefore, he is the grandfather of my life.



  On my father's side, the story is very complicated because my father descends from an Italian family, the Cottinelli.
  My father's name is José Moreira Rodrigues, but he doesn't use Rodrigues, he just uses José Moreira. He was
  the manager of the PAX bookstore here in Braga. That's why he's known as José Moreira from PAX. It turns out that
  Rodrigues is a fake name. It's a complicated family story. His grandfather was one of the Cottinellis. He had some problem,
  he ran away, disappeared, no one knew about him.
  It was assumed that he had died, therefore, he later appeared under the name Rodrigues in a village in the North. He
  married my great-grandmother. We are talking about my great-grandfather, who was a well-educated person, played the
  piano, spoke French, and started out as a teacher in the village. They came to Braga, I don't know exactly how. Then,
  as he began to grow older, he gave some indications that he belonged to the Cottinelli family. My father had a very
  strong relationship with him, let's say he was my father's cultural reference, as he was a very cultured person. When they
  went to the cinema to see Leão da Estrela, their grandfather, once in a while
  every now and then, he said fleetingly, when the name of director Cottinelli Telmo appeared:



  - "That's your cousin."



  Until my father started to get suspicious and when he was almost dying, he ended up confessing that he was from the
  Cottinelli family, and was recognized by his sister, so he ended up being with him. My father never managed to recover
  the Cottinelli name, so Rodrigues is a false name that he adopted from the companion he ran away with. That must have
  been some bohemian scene, some more dramatic episode must have happened there and he fled to Spain.
  After returning, his partner died and he adopted his name when he returned. My father was unable to recover his
  name because there was, however, an uncle who already had companies and it was very complicated. My father was a
  very peaceful person, he never wanted to get into trouble with inheritances and things like that, because there was also
  money and assets at stake. He ended up giving up. I feel sorry because, in fact, the Cottinellis were an interesting family.
  Cottinelli is a well-known figure of the Estado Novo, he was an architect, painter, musician, etc.




  Regarding my mother's family, she has French ancestry. They say that the name Marado comes from "Marat" which
  has to do with the French revolutions, that there was a Marat who stayed in Beira Alta and conceived the progenitors
  that later resulted in Marados. But it's funny that we are the only family with the name Marado.




  Regarding my French ancestry, I don't know if they were great-grandparents or great-great-grandparents. My mother was
  born in Beira Alta, she was the daughter of farmers. My grandfather was a primary school teacher and so was my
  grandmother, so they were already people with some status in the village. So, let's say they were children of
  average farmers, not rich, but well-off.



  As for the profession, my father has a story! My father is self-taught, so he has the 2nd year of the cycle, which is now
  equivalent to the 7th year. He started working in a factory very early. My grandmother was a primary school teacher. My
  paternal grandfather was a revolutionary, a trade unionist, who spent most of his time unemployed, so they lived in
  difficulties. My father was always, under the influence of his grandfather Cottinelli, a person with a very strong intellectual
  side, he cultivated himself. He also had a group of friends who supported him. He worked in the public service, at the
  Ministry of Labor, as an employee. At that time he met my mother. But in the meantime, he became a journalist,
  becoming editor-in-chief and director of Correio do Minho, as a side activity. He also worked at Mocidade Portuguesa,
  until he left everything and dedicated himself to the Pax bookstore, as manager. I
Machine Translated by Google
  I always remember my father as being a man of books. But he is, in fact, self-taught.
  In terms of educational qualifications, he has practically none.



  My mother was a social worker by accident because my mother wanted to take a Portuguese-French course. However, he
  failed Latin in his entry to university, and as he didn't want to repeat the year, he decided to become a social worker. It was
  the biggest mistake of her life. My mother is also a person with a very high cultural level, I think. He should have
  dedicated himself to Portuguese-French. That's what she does with her grandchildren. He did it with his children and he
  does it with his grandchildren. However, we are 8 brothers. A
  my mother had 8 children, was a social worker, taught Home Economics at Carlos Amarante. He also taught at
  the Industrial School, at Alberto Sampaio, on Rua do Castelo. Meanwhile, she wrote a book on Home Economics, reviewed
  exams, in short, my mother was a woman with an extraordinary amount of work to feed a family with 8 children.

  It was very complicated.



  ## "A family different from the norm..." ##




  I have family memories: some good, some bad, because we were a somewhat chaotic family. There were 8 of us, plus
  the grandfather, the maid, and the maid's son, so it was a complicated world. I usually say that at home we have two
  generations: the four oldest and the four youngest.




  My brothers lived through the 60s, so everything was very revolutionary, everything was very left-wing, with all the
  problems that that brings. I had a family that was a little different from normal, perhaps. A bit disorganized in some sense,
  because there was little space and there were a lot of us.
  Each one with their own political and personal activities, with many generational conflicts between my parents and my older
  brothers. But at the same time I had all the family support from my mother, who was a person with a lot of work, but who
  never forgot that she had children and that she had to help them with their homework.




  My mother worked from morning to night because, at that time, social workers provided support at Casas do Povo, visiting
  them after work. So my mother worked until midnight. I got home at midnight and left home at 7 in the morning. There
  were days when I didn't even see her. But my mother was a fantastic person. He never forgot to correct his homework.




  Family activities were few, except for the holidays we spent in Esposende, where
  We were, in fact, all together. It was very complicated to put 8 children in a car. Therefore, I remember Christmas and Easter
  as being holidays spent with the family.



  I always had a good relationship with my brothers, from the oldest to the youngest, I was
  always the beloved girl at home. My older brothers helped me a little to get to know
  the world, to get to know life. They introduced me to books. My father was a bookseller, but he only let me read the books
  that interested him, he didn't let me read the others. Therefore, access to this type of information was allowed through my
  older brothers, mainly through one who is now a journalist, who was, let's say, the most dedicated to Literature. I lived
  more in the nucleus of the four youngest. We were very united, very supportive. We had a fantastic maid, who was almost
  like our second mother. I have great memories. He was a normal child.

  From my childhood games, I remember that I never really liked playing with dolls, I always
  I was the tomboy at home. I remember that what I liked most was playing cowboys.
  At that time, that very well-known American series was on, with cowboys and Indians. And I played a lot with the boys, in
  the type of activities of climbing the pine trees, riding the smaller pine trees as if they were horses, riding a bike, doing some
  cross-country riding.
  Anyway, there were very masculine games. I remember starting to play with dolls very late because my father forbade me to
  play with boys, he thought I was being abusive and I only played with boys, so there was a time, when I was 10 years
  old, when he forbade me to play with dolls. play with the boys.




  I reacted to my father's ban badly, very badly. I remember standing on the balcony watching them play and I cried a lot
  because I was forbidden to play with the boys. My father began to think that there was some levity there that needed to be
  corrected, and it was nothing, they were just normal jokes.




  I have always had a great passion for animals, children and people. I adopted dogs
  everyone, the cats, the parakeets. In fact, animals were a passion for me, and they still are today. And I feel really sorry for not
   having space to have animals. We had a cat a while ago. I really like animals but I can't see them trapped, so I have to
  see animals in freedom. So I forced the cat, I forced her to have freedom. I was the one who taught her how to go outside
  because the first time I took her out, she scratched my neck and the second time too. I forced her and walked the cat on a
  leash, until she discovered that going outside is a fantastic thing. Then she began to abuse and no longer stopped at home,
  until three years later we had the misfortune of her dying after being run over by a car. And from then on I swore that I never
  wanted to have any animal again because, in fact, it is very difficult and I am not capable of keeping an animal in prison.




  I remember that, since I was little, we had some doves that were offered by one of my father's employees. One day I
  decided to open the cage for the doves, but I kept thinking that they would come back. It was with great sadness that my
  mother made me realize that doves did not survive because they did not know how to live outside of captivity. I've always
  had this obsession with animals running wild.




  ## Good student ##




  I had a very difficult primary school because I had a very demanding teacher. Therefore, it was somehow a trauma in
  my life because it had a lot of duties. I spent the afternoons doing homework. I was a somewhat disadvantaged child because
  I had a lot of homework to do and, sometimes, I didn't have time to play.




  I was very afraid of the teacher, because she hit me. She only hit me once with the so-called rulers and I never gave her a
  chance to hit me again. Therefore, I became the best student in the class. I usually say that I was always the best student in
  high school because I was afraid of the primary teacher. So that was, in fact, dramatic for me.




  I had one of my sisters, who is a year older than me, who failed the first class, so we did the journey together. As she was a
  huge cabolona, I had to
Machine Translated by Google
  do her homework for her. So I did mine and then I did hers. I imitated her handwriting, to see if she wouldn't get beaten up
  the next day. From that point of view it was difficult. In fact, I was very afraid. I think I experienced panic situations in relation
  to that teacher. Otherwise I had a normal childhood, I played like everyone else, I was always with my younger brother
  behind me, with my sister too.




  After completing primary school, and getting rid of that witchy teacher, I went to school, to André Soares. Therefore, I
  did the first and second year of the cycle at André Soares. It was funny!
  At that time there was a boys' and a girls' section, although it was mixed, but we had separate networks. I remember going to
  the school director's office, Dr. Braga Simões, many times,
  getting my ears pulled because I went over to the boys' side.



  I always had some difficulty integrating into classes, because, as my sister and I were together, I was a very good
  student and my sister was a very bad student, my mother always asked us to stay together. And, then, there was a selection
  method, which I think is now unfortunately still practiced, for example at Carlos Amarante, classes A, B, C are the classes of
  the best students, and then the classes towards the end of the year worst alphabet in the class. Therefore, I would always end
  up in the worst classes to stay with my sister, instead of the other way around. Therefore, I always had very strange classes
  because they were repeating students, they were monsters around me, already women, and I was very childish.




  Therefore, there was a disparity there and I didn't fit in very well because they already had a very different
  mentality than mine. I remember that in cycle the class was very strange, everyone was already painting themselves and I
  was a girl, I was 10 or 11 years old, and, therefore, that made me a bit confused. Then in high school this continued.




  I was always in the classes with the worst students. What happened is that then some environment ended up being created
  and I was then their mother. I helped them with their tests, I helped them copy, in short, I was a bit like the second teacher.
  Sometimes there were conflicts. I was a very good student and distinguished myself very easily. In fact, I usually say
  that I was a very good student because it wasn't difficult to distinguish myself from others. They were so weak, in fact, that
  it was very easy to make a distinction there. It was a very weak group. Suddenly "Cecília dos 20", as I was known,
  appeared
  in high school. I hated people calling me "Cecília of 20", it was almost like an insult, but, in fact, it was exactly because the
  whole class was negative and I was 20. I took a test in a quarter of an hour.
  I think it was a normal thing, always supporting my sister.



  I remember saying when I was a little girl that I wanted to be a flight attendant because I wanted to travel.
  All my colleagues wanted to be hairdressers and I wanted to travel, I wanted to be a flight attendant and
  My father said that "being a flight attendant was like being a servant from the air", and that confused me, because I didn't
  want to be a servant. So I ended up giving up being a flight attendant and then decided to become a doctor.




  We had a neighbor who at Easter always received little goats to kill, they cried a lot and I spent hours giving them
  milk through a bottle. They put us in the chicken coop, and I spent hours there keeping the lamb company. The day they
  killed him I went crazy.
  So I decided I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to go to Medicine. This is when I was 13/14 years old, wanting to go to
  doctors without borders. And I convinced myself that this was, in fact, my vocation. I'm not sure if it would have been or not
  if things had gone well.

  As I was a good student, I combined the useful with the pleasant and got into Medicine with some ease,
  this in 1978. I took the exam, I got very good grades, I had a good average, I had an average of 19
  points, so I got into Medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of Porto with ease.
  However, when I had the propaedeutic, it was the first time I had explanations. I agreed to have it because,
  at that time, the propaedeutic was done with classes on television and that was, in fact, horrible, it couldn't
  be tolerated. For the first time I agreed to have some support, so I took classes at Externato Carvalho Araújo
  and there was an extraordinary Physics teacher, who was Engenheiro Lima, and a Mathematics
  teacher, who was Carvalho Araújo, who was known as Zé with bicycles. He was an extraordinary teacher.
  He always told me that he didn't understand why I was going to Medicine, that I should go to Systems
  and Computer Engineering because he had a fantastic knack for Mathematics. In fact, it was true,
  Mathematics was a passion for me. But I insisted no, I wanted to go to Medicine because I was always a
  very good student, but I was never brown, I never studied much. He had a good study method. I was very
  disciplined, I think I learned to be extremely methodical in elementary school for self-defense. I
  studied every day what I had learned that day. I would come home and my desk would always be
  brilliantly tidy. The rest of the room was completely untidy, but my desk was always spotless. I
  reviewed what I had done and made a mental synthesis. Therefore, I studied very little. He used to say
  that he could do the job in half an hour. Therefore, I never had homework to do because I had already
  done it.




  I followed the classes and was obsessed with always preparing the previous class. I never went to a class
  without having prepared the previous class, perhaps because of that panic I experienced during my years
  in primary school, afraid that the teacher would ask a question and I wouldn't know. That teacher was
  always at the forefront of beating me, because she hated me. I was the only student who entered and
  didn't greet her, didn't give her a kiss. There was no hypocrisy in my relationship with her.
  I didn't like her and therefore didn't pretend. I never pretended. Since I was a little girl, I have always been very prou
  I greeted her, said good morning, but I never gave her a kiss. Everyone gave him a kiss except me. I
  thought that any opportunity would serve to beat me and it was true.


  So much so that I got a 20 in the fourth grade exam and it was complicated because, at that time, it
  was the teachers who were going to do the exams, and they didn't want to give a 20. I had the complete
  test, without any missing commas. I remember my teacher saying to my mother:


  - "I forced them to give 20, because they didn't want to give him 20, because they never gave 20 to anyone."


  I remember looking at her with great contempt and saying:


  - "Finally he recognized that I was the best student in the class."


  She never recognized this, she always found a way for someone else to have a better grade than me,
  who was her favorite. So, I was never the best student, I always was and I knew I was, but officially I never
  was, until the fourth class exam where I got 20 and the other got 16 or 17.
  But, well, maybe because that stuck with me, I always had that thing of preparing classes and then I had the
  luxury of not studying for the tests because I didn't need to. Studying for tests meant helping others clear
   up doubts and explaining the material to them.

  I entered Medicine and entered a completely separate world because the Medicine course is a course
  It's difficult, the academic environment is horrible, horrible, it's almost indescribable. You enter a world of people that we
  don't imagine exist, with a competitiveness, something horrible,
  in addition to studying horribly. Therefore, I clearly realized that it was not what I wanted. I lasted the first year, the second. In
  fact, I took the last course, which cost me a lot, to prove to my father that I wanted to give up not because I failed, but
  because I really didn't want to because that was violence for me. In fact, it was studied brutally. To prepare for an Anatomy
  exam, and I was considered a bigot among those, I studied very little compared to my colleagues, but I can say that we
  studied for three weeks, an average of 10 to 12 hours a day, which is crazy anyone. And it wasn't worth
  studying too far in advance because that would have to ruin everything.




  The only course I liked taking was Physiology, which was the only course that had something rational, in which we could
  understand and use intelligence to understand the functioning mechanisms of the organism. To sum it all up, I
  ended up not having a bad average, I had an average of 14, it wasn't that bad. That started to create terrible problems for
  me because I couldn't handle that pressure. And then there were theoretical exams, practical exams, oral exams. For
  a chair we did three exams. Essentially I couldn't handle the environment.




  I think I was also unlucky, the group I met was a horrible group, if there were six people who got away with it all, it
  would be a lot. It was a competitive class, hiding notes from each other. I have an episode in an Anatomy exam, in which I
  took
  a question to the colleague next door, those were multiple answer tests, I asked him if he knew, because he was a person
  who I let copy a lot, but I never copied, but there, in fact, we
  I had to copy something because it was all memorized. And instead of answering me, he asked me 10 questions, and
  I kept telling him everything I knew. "Do you know this? Do you know this?" and I was telling him everything I knew. And at
  the end, around 10, I started to think "Oh man, what did I ask you, don't you know?" And he turned to me and replied:
  "Did you think I was going to tell you? You're so stupid!" Well, I got up to give him a cornucopia, and the only reason I didn't
  was because a colleague of mine tied me up because I was going to make a huge mess during the Anatomy exam, because
  the teacher was going to realize that something had happened there. But these were the types of people in my class, who
  were very difficult to deal with.




  Teachers humiliated students. That was a humiliating experience, it started at the top, the professors humiliated the
  assistants, the assistants humiliated the monitors, it was a chain process. Therefore, they treated the students like dogs and
  the students treated each other like dogs, there was nothing in the least... And I realized that it was not that class of people
  that I wanted to share the rest of my life with. I did not want! And that was a bit what led me to give up. "Are these my
  colleagues in the future? Are these the people I'm going to live with on a daily basis? I can't stand this, I can't stand it, I don't
  like these people, this isn't my world.", and I decided to give up.




  It was a very difficult choice, but I think it was the best thing I did in my life. It was hard for me to give up because it was
  giving up on a vocation. And in the midst of this confusion I didn't know what to do because
  I gave up on a course and had never thought of an alternative. That was my vocation. So I had to choose a course and all that
  came to mind was what the propaedeutic teacher had told me:




  - "You're going to Systems and IT."
Machine Translated by Google

  And so, that's how I ended up at Systems and Informatics. Therefore, this was two years after entering Medicine, perhaps
  in 1980.



  I was suffering a lot from that whole environment. I hated my colleagues, so I felt like not interacting with anyone.
  Furthermore, he had a problem of stress in relation to studying. I couldn't sit down and study. I have always been a
  person who liked to study, I was not able to change the page until I had understood the previous page, knowledge was
  something that interested me. I was completely stressed, I could no longer

  sitting in the chair for 5 minutes studying, I had to get up, I had to do something.
  So that experience was very hard for me. That wasn't my way of studying, it wasn't compatible with me. I think it was stupid.




  I hope that the Medicine or Health Sciences course, which they created here at the University of Minho, fulfills what is in the
  plan and that, in fact, it is a different course, it is a modern course and an interesting course because, in fact, that violates
   anyone. I usually say that there is no one who leaves there with their head straight. When I was in the Senate and
  they presented the project, I jokingly said:




  - "I'm finally going to finish my Medicine course here at the University of Minho!"



  Because, in fact, if the course meets its objectives, if the program is fulfilled, I think it is a course that breaks with a
  lot of things that are wrong in the teaching of Medicine, which is brutal.



  So, in the first years when I came here, I started out as an average student, I got about 10, 11 and so on because I didn't
  study, I studied very little, with the exception of some subjects like Mathematics, in which I had some preparation,
  and Physics. But in the first year and the first semester of the second year I didn't study. I had to spend some time clearing
  my head. Furthermore, I didn't feel like spending much time with my colleagues, I thought they were all jerks, I couldn't
  put up with them. So I lived in my corner, a little apart. Until I integrated because I discovered that the University of Minho
  was completely different. It was the university I wanted, it was the space I liked, this was how I understood a university,



    which was being able to interrupt a teacher in a class and clarify a doubt, which was something that could not be done
  in Medicine. In Medicine, the first time I interrupted a professor to do
    one question I was insulted.



  I realized that this was a completely different world and I adapted, although with some difficulties because I had some
  problems to solve in my head, problems in relation to studying, in relation to the relationship with my colleagues, but in
  relation to the teachers it didn't take me long I spent a long time realizing that I was at a completely different university.
  We were very few students, I suppose we were 60, but in the second year we were 30, while in Medicine we were 300.




  I remember Professor Valença. The first class I had with Professor Valença was mind-blowing. May Professor Valença
  forgive me, I have immense respect and immense consideration for him, as he knows, but the first time I saw him I thought
  he was in the hospital. This was in the first classes, I still didn't know the spaces well. I ended up in a room, a very
  strange place, the facilities were terrible, with very little light, it felt like we were going through tunnels and then
Machine Translated by Google
  We were going to stop there. Suddenly, a stuttering teacher appeared to me, talking and hitting his leg with his hand,
  stuttering. It was Professor Valença. Professor Valença is like this: he wrote the tire algorithm on the board, and wrote
  "peneu" with "e". I was hallucinating and saying:



  - "I ended up at a university of crazy people, this is all crazy people. This man is completely crazy. Where
  am I? Where did I end up?"



  I remember that the first class I had with Professor Valença was horrible, an absolute panic, because I thought the man
  was crazy, especially with all those tics.
  Evidently, it didn't take many classes to realize that Professor Valença was my master. He was, in fact, a fantastic person,
  with incredible ease of communication and, in fact, he became my reference at university.




  Valença was my teacher, he was a fantastic person, with incredible communication skills.
  In fact, he became my reference at university. Professor Valença as a teacher, in fact, is a teacher of excellence. I didn't
  understand why he was only our teacher in the first and second year. Why in the third year we cut the umbilical cord
  with him, because I thought he was my master, therefore, he should accompany me from the beginning of the year to
  the end.
  There must have been a bit of a culture of the master, of the disciples who accompany the master, "Leornado da Vinci and
  his disciples." Therefore, I wanted to be Professor Valença’s disciple. He was a teacher
  fantastic, but demanding. I was never a brilliant student with him because for him only Murta was capable of getting good
  grades. Okay, that's when I started to get to know the University of Minho and realized that, in fact, the academic world and
  the University of Minho were something important to me.




  The classrooms were at D. Pedro V. The rooms were small, I mean, it wasn't that bad, but it looked a bit like a primary
  school, it didn't look like a university, much more so for someone who comes from the Faculty of Medicine, who is
  enormous in size. That was weak, but I never complained much about the conditions. For the people I had at the time,
  conditions weren't too bad. I think the facilities were much worse for the teachers than for us. We had classrooms, we
  had amphitheaters and we had some laboratories. Teachers did not have offices. In terms of infrastructure, it was more
  penalizing for teachers than for us students.




  In terms of material, computers, that was a lot to laugh about. We started working on Wang, then it was 50 dogs to a bone.
  My brother was an operator at the time, this thing about me being my brother's boss is a coincidence. In fact, it was
  unbearable, there were nights spent there and then
  As Moreira was a great guy, he let us stay there through the night. We worked until 2 and
  3 am because there were very few terminals, we could only work two or three.




  I, in fact, never really liked programming, I liked making algorithms, now programming wasn't my thing. I always had a
  scheme with my groupmate, who was also a person a little different from the others, he was a little marginalized. I also
  marginalized myself. In the first year I was a bit marginalized by my colleagues. Nobody wanted to be in a group with
  me, they thought
  everyone said that I was a very strange person and I ended up with Abílio, who I don't think anyone wanted to be in a group
  with, I don't know why either. So, it was just me and Abílio. We became great friends and workmates and, then, I created the
  algorithm and Abílio programmed. It was the business we had. Using computers was never something I really
  enjoyed. I
Machine Translated by Google
  I liked the more theoretical part. The part about getting your hands dirty and going there to program and that
  Making a mistake and going back was not my thing. It was a lot of stress for my head. I was never a
  very good programmer.


  Regarding my relationships with colleagues, in my first class I never had great relationships. I don't
  know, I think I was a few holes above them in terms of mentality, the way of being. I didn't really like
  that group. I have some references like Luís Romero, who has always been a great friend, but
  there was also... I don't know, I think it was a weak group. There was Murta, everyone knows Murta,
  who clearly stood out from the others, Abílio was also a good student, but in terms of overall training,
  he didn't have the level that Murta had.
  Therefore, they were not of much interest to me. It was a weak group, very opportunistic. In fact, I didn't
  like that group. I didn't like the people, I thought they were very opportunistic people, with a lot of
  intrigues from one teacher to another, a lot of hypocrisy, and I never played games like that,
  neither for the teachers nor against them. There were a lot of things there that I didn't like. They
  they treated teachers who were beastly and not arrogant badly, with those who were arrogant
  They were as silent as mice and no one said anything. Therefore, there was a way of being there that
  had nothing to do with me. Therefore, my irreverence has always been fair and correct and I have never been
  in favor of the students just to get me off the hook or to get them off. I always had a stance
  that I consider, I could be wrong, but from my point of view it was a serious stance. It was a group that I
  didn't identify with nor did they identify much with me. I even think that they personally didn't like me
   very much, precisely because they thought I had to be on their side and I wasn't always on their side. I
  thought I had to be on the side of reason, as I always thought and often reason was on the side of the
  teachers and not them.


  Later, as I took a break from my course to become a mother, I went to find another class that had much
  more to do with me and when I think of a class I think of them and not the first class I had.


  In the first year, the subject that had the most interest was the Algorithms subject with Professor Valença,
  because besides, we and the engineering students had a common core, therefore, the chairs were the
  chairs of all engineering areas: Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry. That was of no interest whatsoever.
  In the IT area, if I'm not mistaken, we only had Algorithms with Professor Valença, in the first year,
  and then in the second year with Professor Pedro Henriques, and we had the Programming chair with
  Professor Mário Martins. That's what I remember, otherwise they were ordinary trunk chairs, which
  were absolute nonsense.


  I had already taken Mathematics, Physics and on top of that they were mass classes because there
  were a lot of people. The specialty courses were the most interesting because there were few of us
  and we had a very interesting relationship with Professor Valença. I think he can't maintain it now
  because he has a lot of students, but, at that time, we had coffee with him, we went to his office to ask
  questions whenever we felt like it. There was a very good relationship, even with all the teachers, not
  only with Valença, but also with professor Mário Martins.


  The teachers I remember from the first years are Professor Valença, Professor Mário Martins, Professor Pedro Henriques
  and then I also remember, in the second year, Professor João Monteiro, Alexandre Santos, who were the assistants at that
  time. , which provided some support in practices, which were introduced later, perhaps in the second year. I already
  remember working with them: João Monteiro and Alexandre.




  With me, classes are always attended because I don't let the teachers talk much
Machine Translated by Google
  alone. Therefore, I think that at the University of Minho this happened because the teachers allowed it. I was also
  never one to always ask questions to boycott classes, but I think the classes were well attended and the teachers were
  very open to this participation. There is
    Shier, less shy teachers, who teach classes facing the board, there are those who look students in the eyes. When there
  were teachers who were unquestionably competent people in the area, but who, often, pedagogically were unable to
  communicate with the students, then I forced a little and my colleagues followed, forcing them to realize that we existed, we
  were there, that we had doubts.




  I think the relationship between teachers and students was good. There was a group of privileged people there
  who had a lot of access to teachers, almost immediate access to teachers. There were very few of us.




  As for bibliographical support for the common core chairs: Physics, Mathematics, there were always recommended books,
  I don't remember there being booklets. In the specialty courses, teachers were already making notes. I remember
  Professor Valença's notebooks, which I keep with great affection, which were handwritten by him, in tiny handwriting. He
  wrote all the notes by hand and provided them, he taught classes and made the notes, that was almost

  at the end of the sentence. I used to say that Professor Valença's notes read like someone reading a novel. In fact, he could
  transform what was complex and complicated into simple things. He simplified everything. I think that IT is a myth, everyone
  has the idea that IT is complicated and Professor Valença showed us the opposite. He demystified what

  It seemed, at first, very complicated. He had a fantastic ability to teach. He was, in fact, a reference teacher. Professor Mário
  Martins also made sebentas, but I didn't like it as much because they were too much... and Professor Valença's ones were
  just a matter of time, so it was a speech. Professor Mário Martins's was more of a guide type and I didn't like it so much
  anymore. But it was our material
  study, plus the notes we took in class.



  It took me a long time to finish the course because I stopped for two years. Then I found a fantastic group, Olga Pacheco's
  group, Alexandra, in short, fantastic people. I entered the specialty, through formal specification with Professor Zé Nuno.
  So we had a fantastic group. It was a group of very good people, with a lot of level, not only good students, but a very
  interesting way of being. I think that then I found people I identified with, because they were all very good. I was
  used to always being the best in the class and, in fact, I found that, although at university I was never the best in the
  class, there were always students better than me. In the first group with Murta and Abílio, who were the ones I considered
  very good... That group was, in fact, a fantastic group, with a fantastic level and then very good people, very cool, for whom



  I have a great affection. And I was very scared because I thought there was a huge generation gap there, I was afraid I
  wouldn't fit in, but, in fact, I fit in very well. With Nani and many people I haven't seen for many years, I feel very
  sorry.




  I have many funny episodes to tell. I think I didn't exactly have a very peaceful passage during my student days because I was
  very irreverent, post-25th April. I assumed
  very much the role of irreverent. So we had a Mathematical Analysis teacher who I hated and vice versa, who was a
  teacher from Porto, who later left. I remember that classes would get to the point where everyone was waiting to see who
  would start talking to each other. So, suddenly, under the pretext of something, he would say something, I would
  respond and it would never stop, it was a ping-pong effect and the students were laughing all the time.

  We maintained a diplomatic level of mutual aggression there, but almost always at the limit.

  I remember that there was a time, after the 25th of April, when the PCP raised the issue of abortion and this professor
  was from the UDP. Therefore, from time to time he would introduce some political questions in class and talk about the
  liberalization of abortion:



  - "And at least abortion should be discriminated against when there are cases of anomalies and physical disabilities
  or psychic."



  And I remember interrupting him to say:



  -"It was incredibly bad luck that the law didn't come out sooner because if it had, you wouldn't have been born."



  But it was, in fact, a fantastic joke and it was the joke of the year because I called it "abortion" in a sophisticated way.




  Then there were many funny episodes, because I had a dog, a huge Serra da Estrela.
  I remember many episodes because the dog was always after me and there were very funny things because the
  dog came into classes. The dog came into the room, looked for me and I already had
  a fixed place for the dog to sit next to. There were some funny episodes because there were chairs that I would later
  give up on and stop going to class and the dog would continue to go to class. One day the teacher turned around and
  said:



  - "The dog is more diligent than the owner."



  I missed classes and the dog, from time to time, would look for me and come there.



  There are other funny moments. For example, with Professor Valença, who was afraid of dogs. By that time, we already
  had the IT Center, which was above the Gulbenkian café, which we called "O Espelunca". I spent hours of my life there
  and the dog was always under the chair. The dog, which was huge, as it was very hot, he used to lie down, there was a
  very large rug in the apartment, in the computer room and he liked to lie down there, he stretched himself out. When

  As people passed by, he started playing and biting their feet and Professor Valença was afraid of stepping over the dog.
  So, there were all the operators:



  -"Pass it, Professor Valença, the dog doesn't hurt!"



  I gave him demonstrations so he could pass, but Professor Valença had to send for me so I could get the dog out. Nobody
  took the dog away, just me. So, sometimes, I had to leave classes because someone would come running for me to take the
  dog so that Professor Valença could pass, because he was afraid of the dog. And with that dog I have lots of funny
  episodes. The dog went with me everywhere. The dog, from time to time, got upset and was very funny because he would get up
  while the teacher was talking, sit in front of the teacher and then start with his head to one side, head to the other, and raise
  his ears. , he watched until the teacher began to order:
Machine Translated by Google

  -"Get that dog out of here."


  Every now and then I would throw him out on the street, but he would go back again. Until he got upset and left.


  One time we were doing a test and the dog walked over, smelled the teacher and decided to leave.
  And the teacher said:


  -"Looks like we have a forfeit."


  I answered him:


  -"Well, teacher, this isn't even for dogs."


  There are some jokes, some funnier ones, but I don't remember them.


  The dog came to the university every day. I lived very close to the university, so he could find me
  anywhere in the city. He walked all over the city after me. I used to
   say I didn't get a dog, I got a policeman. As much as I didn't want to and left him trapped at home,
  no one could stand him and when they released him he would look for me in the places where he
  usually found me. He looked for me everywhere and I often took him to classes, which was
  preferable. He sat there, behaved well.


  The teachers didn't complain about the dog, I think the teachers didn't mess with me much, they
  gave up messing with me, it wasn't worth it. Okay, but there were some teachers who messed with
  me.


  I remember professor Edite Fernandes who once went crazy when the dog entered her office. But
  what could I do? No one held the dog.


  Sometimes I would lock him up at home, but then he would throw himself at the door and no
  one could stand him at home. Sometimes I had to put the dog out because there were people who
  didn't like it. I kept him on the leash outside. But there was a very open and liberal environment,
  which I think is perhaps not possible now. It is an attack to bring a dog into the classroom. Not
  at that time, the teachers also knew me, they also had some consideration for me, they knew that the fact th
  the dog wasn't supposed to upset anyone, it was because the dog wouldn't let go of me.
  Those are the funny episodes I remember.


  Another funny moment, I remember the first big computer we had was an MV8000. He was
  One Saturday morning the computer arrived. A crane had to come from the Port of Leixões
  and the computer had to enter through the window. I remember watching that, me, Professor Valença
  and my brother, Moreira, who was the operator. Professor Valença almost prayed that the
  computer wouldn't fall. The great machine, the great investment that was the MV8000. I watched
  the birth of the machine.

  It was the first large computer in the computer center. It was a huge cabinet, with many pieces on the sides,
  records were taken from one side to the other. Was so funny. I had a very strong connection with the university
  and had all the doors open, even going on Saturdays to help put the computer inside the facilities. I have
  always had a very strong connection with the Informatics Center, first with Professor Valença, then with Professor
  Proença.


  ## Love for animals ##




  We had a neighbor who at Easter always received little goats to kill, they cried a lot and I spent hours
  giving them milk through a bottle. They put us in the chicken coop, and I spent hours there keeping the lamb
  company. The day they killed him I went crazy.
  So I decided I wanted to be a doctor, I wanted to go to Medicine. This is when I was 13/14 years old, wanting to go to
  doctors without borders. And I convinced myself that this was, in fact, my vocation. I'm not sure if it would have been or not
  if things had gone well.

  ## "I am divorced" ##




  I am currently not married. I am divorced.



  ## "Two children" ##




  I have two children. I have a boy, Pedro Nuno, who is 16 years old, he will be 17, and I have a girl called Maria João, who
  is now 13 years old. They live with me in Braga.




  Before going to university I did some psychotechnical tests with a guy, who was a friar friend of my father who did
  psychotechnical tests. He said I could be anything, I had to follow the teaching path because I had a fantastic way of
  teaching. In fact, I had some vocation because since I was little I gave explanations to my brothers and cousins.
  At the age of 15, he was already earning money tutoring. Therefore, I had that thing of helping my colleagues. He
  was, in fact, quite easy to teach. My daughter says that I am her best teacher, that I explain much better than
  her teachers. So this is significant, I think I have a calling for this. I taught, I was a monitor, I even taught
  master's degrees at the Institute of Social Sciences, I gave many training courses. I think I have a knack for teaching.



  I felt a bit like pursuing a teaching career.



  I was in fourth year when I decided to get married and have a child. I had to start working to support the family.
  Things got complicated. At that time, I was already a monitor in the Engineering IT department. I gave practical classes,
  was a monitor and often played the role of assistant, because the assistants were new and not familiar with the
  subjects. I worked a lot, I was a monitor, but I worked a lot. I taught Civil Engineering and some other engineering,
  which I don't remember now.
Machine Translated by Google
  Then I stopped the course for a while, took a break. There was a year when I didn't make any chairs. I only took a course or two
  for almost two years, but I continued to teach as a monitor. He taught at the Alberto Sampaio school. The Technology and
  IT course began with being taught by professor Mário Martins and professor Pedro Henriques, who then asked me to teach

  and I went to replace them. I suppose when I entered they left. Therefore, I took charge of the IT subjects in the 10th and 11th
  and it was a huge responsibility because there were no programs, it was all very hard. I still did some odd jobs, gave some
  explanations, in short, I did a lot of things. So I spent two years doing nothing, until I decided that it couldn't be done, I had
  to stop.




  My husband was finishing his History course in Porto, and it was very complicated. So, I decided to stop and ask my family
  for help to support me for a while, to see if I could finish the course. I continued to be a monitor, even though I had been hired
  by Professor Proença and worked with Professor Valença. That's when my relationship with Professor Proença began. So, I
  started being his monitor, then I started doing some work at the IT Center, when I finished the course I already had my
  second daughter. In fact, when I finished the course I was pregnant with my second daughter, although I defended the
  internship after she was born.




  I was doing some work with Professor Proença, at the IT Center, doing a financial calculation application, doing some
  things I had to do. He gave me work, he knew I needed money, I created a relationship with the IT Center. Therefore, by
  the time I finished the course I was very tired. He had two children, he had worked like hell.




  At that time, Professor Pina, who is now vice-president of the Informatics Center, which ensured the
  area of UNIX System, went on to a teaching career, left. Therefore, there was a vacant place in the IT Center. At that time I
  was thinking about teaching, because I always wanted to pursue a career in teaching, but I felt terribly tired. I knew I would
  have many responsibilities as a teacher. But at the same time I felt very tired. I wanted a responsibility that began and
  ended. I didn't want to take the problems home. Which ended up not happening! At the same time, I had a lot of emotional
  involvement with the IT Center: with Necho, who is my colleague, with Professor Proença. I felt that Professor Proença
  needed me at the IT Center and I decided to stay there as a senior technician. Later,



  There was always the possibility of change.



  I could have become Professor Proença's assistant. At that time, I thought it would be easier to change, when I felt more
  comfortable and less tired. Then I would transition to a teaching career without any problem. It is clear that a few years have
  passed and things have become very complicated. At that time, there was a huge lack of people who wanted to stay at
  university, precisely because they earned very little and out there they earned much more. There was a huge lack of
  teachers in the IT area. So I chose to stay at the IT Center for a while, also to acquire some professional practice.




  I started working at the Center, but then a problem arose: suddenly, my Unix service stopped
  up and I had to get my hands dirty and, in fact, it was very difficult because the service was very complex and I had
  no training whatsoever. I had to study a lot, take manuals home, pass
  weekends working. I worked a lot. Later I wanted to switch to a teaching career.
Machine Translated by Google



  I got a little tired of working at the IT Center because this job had a very thankless side, there was a lot of work behind the
  scenes, so there was no visibility, no recognition.
  of work. Furthermore, the service was of poor quality. The image that people on the outside have is of poor quality service,
  when we work like beasts. I used to work for three or four people. Everything fell on top of me. I got a little tired of always
  working a lot and getting very little return.




  Professor Proença convinced me to do a master's degree. I, in fact, didn't have any desire to do a master's degree
  because I was very tired, I wanted to rest, because I hadn't stopped yet. But he convinced me and I entered the master's
  degree. If I had a master's degree, perhaps I could choose to pursue a teaching career. It was a bit of a hassle to have the
  weapons in your hand, to be able to use them if you wanted. Then, at that point, I felt like it and applied for the department
  several times. It was very disappointing because every time I went to interviews they praised me a lot, as well as the
  work I had done.
  I did it, but then I was never placed, because there was always someone who had a master's degree who was legitimately
  ahead of me. Then things ended up taking care of themselves.



  Then I had a serious health problem, which made my life very complicated and it took me a long time to finish my
  master's degree because of it. From then on I had a complicated life because I have a health problem that has not been
  completely resolved. I had a cancer problem. At that point I realized:




  -"It's a good thing I'm not in a teaching career. It's a good thing I'm at the IT Center.
  Good thing I have a stable job."



  If this were not the case, the situation could become more complicated. A teacher has obligations to
  fulfill, he has to complete master’s degrees, doctorates, etc. In fact, I was free from it all. I ended up
  finishing my master's degree and, that's it, here I am with weapons in hand.


  We are currently restructuring the IT Center. In fact, before it was operated, we had started a restructuring process,
  this was in 1999. We changed the IT Center regulations, so we were going to start again. In fact, the service was very
  bad, the quality of service provided was very bad, we were very behind technologically, it was

  I need to take a look at the service. Therefore, I committed myself body and soul to restructuring the service with the help of
  Professor Proença, my colleague Engineer Mário Necho and Professor
  Pina, who was my consultant, who was my master's advisor. But it was a lot of my work. What happened was that we
   restructured the center, we started all over again, but suddenly I got sick, my colleague went on unpaid leave to Kosovo
  and the house collapsed, because there was no one to support it. We had already started, so there was no turning back.
  For this reason the process is very delayed. It is clear that Professor Pina invested a lot, even though I was on sick leave, I
  also invested a lot. Right now, I think we are at the ideal point to present

  a new, redesigned IT Center, with good services. In the past we had a terrible lack of specialized personnel. At this
  moment, we already have a more stabilized situation, but we also had to fight for it. We already have a comfortable
  number of engineers. As we all know, you can't make omelettes without eggs.




  I was off work for a long time, a year and a half, because then I had a horrible pain problem and had to undergo opiate-
  based pain treatment, which disabled me intellectually.
Machine Translated by Google
  quite. So I started working in May 2001, not that long ago. Which doesn't mean that I haven't worked because I've always
  been involved in the processes, in short, with one foot out and the other in.




  So I took over, it was already planned, to become head of division. Therefore, at this moment I do the coordination. We
  have a plan for the IT director that was drawn up, who is guiding the IT Center restructuring project, which was done
  by Professor Pina, with everyone's collaboration, but it was designed by a specialized company because at
  that time we didn't have people. Anyway, we couldn't touch all the areas.




  Right now what I'm doing is coordinating the work. It is an integrated project that involves work from different areas:
  communications, information systems, computing. Therefore, I coordinate the execution of this work and do
  a lot of management work.
  I am part of the Steering Committee of the IT Center, therefore, I do a lot of management and coordination work. At the
  moment, I'm not doing engineering work, in the strict sense of the word, because I don't have the capacity for it, nor
  do I have the time. I have engineers who work and work very well. At the moment, we have a very good team. I do
  more integration, coordination, articulation so that all the pieces come together and we can set up services.




  I really like what I do. I like it more than programming. I never liked programming, they forced me to program a
  few times in my life and, in fact, I never liked programming. Maybe that's why I really like communications. In fact, the
  first specialization I entered was in communications and it was a real disappointment for me, because, at that time,
  communications were very small things, it wasn't the world it is today. My teachers were Professor Vasco Freitas and
  Professor Proença, that was very "the internet norm I don't know what". It was all very low level, with a lot of hardware
  and I didn't have much preparation for it, so I was very disappointed and in the exam I got a 6. I ended up giving up, it
  wasn't those communications that interested me. I was interested in communications with a more top-down view, not so
  much hardware, so much physics, because I didn't have the slightest electronics training. Therefore, for me,
  programming boards was not, in fact, my calling. But I thought there was a very interesting perspective in
  communications and 10 years later communications are a world. I really like the communications area.




  Later, I invested in the area of formal specification, it was also too theoretical for my head. I ended up doing my
  specialization with Professor Zé Nuno, for whom I have great admiration, but, in fact, that is a world, a very theoretical level.
  It's good for Luís Soares Barbosa and Olga Pacheco, who are brilliant at things, but not for me. I am more earthy

  earth, I need to move it. I like systems administration, I like thinking about projects, how to set up a new computing
  system, distributed systems, Cluster systems (here at
  Computer Center, we were one of the first centers to have a Cluster), I like to design the systems, think about them, then I
  like to get my hands dirty, in terms of systems programming, configuration. Now making programs in C no longer
  does that. I have a lot of admiration for good programmers. I usually say that programming is easy, being a
  good programmer is very difficult. Therefore,
  As I'm not a good programmer, I think it's better to stay in the pits and not program. I know how to program, but I program
  poorly and I don't like it, it causes me a lot of stress.



  In professional terms, I think I'm in the right place. I think I have some management and project coordination skills. I
  think, to be very honest, that I have some gaps in terms of knowledge. I think I needed to invest a lot in self-training right
  now,
Machine Translated by Google
 because things move very fast in IT. We live in the IT Center, each in our own store, each in our chapel with our
 employees. Therefore, I was in the Unix area and my specialization was that, I had my employees. The other was in
 communications and lived closed in that world. The other was from Windows and lived in that world. Okay, Unix is a
 very interesting area, but computing is not that. I've always really liked communications and I always thought we all had
 to work together and we had to have an integrated project. Today in

  Today, large servers no longer make sense, even Unix systems. Microcomputers are beginning to beat large
  computers in terms of performance. Therefore, it was necessary to break with this logic and create a transversal service,
  in which there was some coherence in terms of areas, but where things worked very interconnected. I finally managed to
  convince people that, in fact, this would be the best way to work, but it was difficult. It was necessary to break with
  something
  tradition, break with the resistance that people have to leaving their domain, where they rule, where they have their
  subordinates.



  On the one hand, I feel a bit harmed because I was always forced to be in that area and ended up missing out on all the
  IT transformation that was taking place on the other side. This has evolved in terms of communications, in terms of
  information services. Therefore, I was a bit penalized in that aspect. Then, as I had that health problem, I was very
  late. Although I'm following along, because I have a lot of experience and hear a few things here and there and talk a lot to
  a lot of people who know a lot, at this point I needed to invest in self-education.

  I needed to stop and say this:



  -"Now I'm going to be in my office for three months, I don't do anything other than study."



  I have some difficulty technically keeping up with people. I feel that, at the moment, I have little technical competence
  to technically monitor the people under my responsibility.




  We are currently working with an IT consultant, who is very good and who has given us enormous support. We also need
  to have the humility to recognize that we are not capable and need to seek external support, so we resorted to this
  solution, which I think was very good. This does not mean that I do not have the capacity to monitor, but rather to
  intervene
  I have little technique at the moment.



  In professional terms, what I really wanted was to see the new IT Center grow, because I think we have a fantastic
  project. Let's start providing quality services to our users. We are still in the first phase of implementation, we have a long
   way to go.
  I think that from here we will have a quality IT Center. I think we will have the IT Center that we deserve, because if
  there's one thing I can say, it's that I've always been very involved with the work. And this house has a lot of me, in
  terms of working hours, emotional involvement, in terms of intellectual involvement. Therefore, I often did without
  my family to help the IT Center, that is, the IT Center is more than a second home. My family complains that I live
  more at the IT Center than

  at home. I think I inherited my father's sense of responsibility and, in fact, this has a lot to do with me, as well as a lot
  with my colleagues and everyone who works here. I think people deserve a high-quality, modern IT Center. Then we
  have many employees that we need to make profitable, who are not accounted for, but who are not put on the shelf, they
  have their role to play, but at the moment we still cannot, let's say, reach the stage where we are going to train them and
  we are going to put them into action on the ground. This costs a lot and has not yet been resolved. We have many
  hours of work ahead of us.

  In terms of projects, I've been thinking about this for many years, if things went very well, but I don't think they will go as well
  as that, I think a computer center should be set up at a university in one of the Portuguese-speaking African countries:
  Cabo Verde, S. Tomé, Mozambique. But I think that for this you need to have a lot of technological competence. You don't do
  these things to make money, nor to gain prestige. Basically, it was a dream, one that I've had for a long time, but I don't
  think I ever felt prepared for it.




  ## ##




  I was doing some work with Professor Proença, at the IT Center, doing a financial calculation application, doing some
  things I had to do. He gave me work, he knew I needed money, I created a relationship with the IT Center. Therefore, by
  the time I finished the course I was very tired. He had two children, he had worked like hell.




  At that time, Professor Pina, who is now vice-president of the Informatics Center, which ensured the
  area of UNIX System, went on to a teaching career, left. Therefore, there was a vacant place in the IT Center. At that time I
  was thinking about teaching, because I always wanted to pursue a career in teaching, but I felt terribly tired. I knew I would
  have many responsibilities as a teacher. But at the same time I felt very tired. I wanted a responsibility that began and
  ended. I didn't want to take the problems home. Which ended up not happening! At the same time, I had a lot of emotional
  involvement with the IT Center: with Necho, who is my colleague, with Professor Proença. I felt that Professor Proença
  needed me at the IT Center and I decided to stay there as a senior technician. Later,



  There was always the possibility of change.



  I could have become Professor Proença's assistant. At that time, I thought it would be easier to change, when I felt more
  comfortable and less tired. Then I would transition to a teaching career without any problem. It is clear that a few years have
  passed and things have become very complicated. At that time, there was a huge lack of people who wanted to stay at
  university, precisely because they earned very little and out there they earned much more. There was a huge lack of
  teachers in the IT area. So I chose to stay at the IT Center for a while, also to acquire some professional practice.




  ## Restructuring of the IT Center ##




  I started working at the Center, but then a problem arose: suddenly, my Unix service stopped
  up and I had to get my hands dirty and, in fact, it was very difficult because the service was very complex and I had
  no training whatsoever. I had to study a lot, take manuals home, pass
  weekends working. I worked a lot. Later I wanted to switch to a teaching career.




  I got a little tired of working at the IT Center because this job had a very thankless side, there was a lot of work behind the
  scenes, so there was no visibility, no recognition.

  of work. Furthermore, the service was of poor quality. The image that people on the outside have is of poor quality service,
  when we work like beasts. I used to work for three or four people. Everything fell on top of me. I got a little tired of always
  working a lot and getting very little return.




  Professor Proença convinced me to do a master's degree. I, in fact, didn't have any desire to do a master's degree
  because I was very tired, I wanted to rest, because I hadn't stopped yet. But he convinced me and I entered the master's
  degree. If I had a master's degree, perhaps I could choose to pursue a teaching career. It was a bit of a hassle to have the
  weapons in your hand, to be able to use them if you wanted. Then, at that point, I felt like it and applied for the department
  several times. It was very disappointing because every time I went to interviews they praised me a lot, as well as the
  work I had done.
  I did it, but then I was never placed, because there was always someone who had a master's degree who was legitimately
  ahead of me. Then things ended up taking care of themselves.



  Then I had a serious health problem, which made my life very complicated and it took me a long time to finish my
  master's degree because of it. From then on I had a complicated life because I have a health problem that has not been
  completely resolved. I had a cancer problem. At that point I realized:




  -"It's a good thing I'm not in a teaching career. It's a good thing I'm at the IT Center.
  Good thing I have a stable job."



  If this were not the case, the situation could become more complicated. A teacher has obligations to
  fulfill, he has to complete master’s degrees, doctorates, etc. In fact, I was free from it all. I ended up
  finishing my master's degree and, that's it, here I am with weapons in hand.


  We are currently restructuring the IT Center. In fact, before it was operated, we had started a restructuring process,
  this was in 1999. We changed the IT Center regulations, so we were going to start again. In fact, the service was very
  bad, the quality of service provided was very bad, we were very behind technologically, it was

  I need to take a look at the service. Therefore, I committed myself body and soul to restructuring the service with the help of
  Professor Proença, my colleague Engineer Mário Necho and Professor
  Pina, who was my consultant, who was my master's advisor. But it was a lot of my work. What happened was that we
   restructured the center, we started all over again, but suddenly I got sick, my colleague went on unpaid leave to Kosovo
  and the house collapsed, because there was no one to support it. We had already started, so there was no turning back.
  For this reason the process is very delayed. It is clear that Professor Pina invested a lot, even though I was on sick leave, I
  also invested a lot. Right now, I think we are at the ideal point to present

  a new, redesigned IT Center, with good services. In the past we had a terrible lack of specialized personnel. At this
  moment, we already have a more stabilized situation, but we also had to fight for it. We already have a comfortable
  number of engineers. As we all know, you can't make omelettes without eggs.




  I was off work for a long time, a year and a half, because then I had a horrible pain problem and had to undergo opiate-
  based pain treatment, which made me quite intellectually disabled. So I started working in May 2001, not that long
  ago. Which doesn't mean that I haven't worked because I've always been involved in the processes, in short, with one foot
  out and the other in.

  So I took over, it was already planned, to become head of division. Therefore, at this moment I do
  the coordination. We have a plan for the IT director that was drawn up, who is guiding the IT
  Center restructuring project, which was done by Professor Pina, with everyone's
  collaboration, but it was designed by a specialized company because at that time we didn't have
  people. Anyway, we couldn't touch all the areas.


  Right now what I'm doing is coordinating the work. It is an integrated project that involves work
  from different areas: communications, information systems, computing. Therefore, I
  coordinate the execution of this work and do a lot of management work.
  I am part of the Steering Committee of the IT Center, therefore, I do a lot of management and
  coordination work. At the moment, I'm not doing engineering work, in the strict sense of the
  word, because I don't have the capacity for it, nor do I have the time. I have engineers who
  work and work very well. At the moment, we have a very good team. I do more integration,
  coordination, articulation so that all the pieces come together and we can set up services.



  I really like what I do. I like it more than programming. I never liked programming, they
  forced me to program a few times in my life and, in fact, I never liked programming. Maybe that's
  why I really like communications. In fact, the first specialization I entered was in communications
  and it was a real disappointment for me, because, at that time, communications were very small
  things, it wasn't the world it is today. My teachers were Professor Vasco Freitas and Professor
  Proença, that was very "the internet norm I don't know what". It was all very low level, with a lot
  of hardware and I didn't have much preparation for it, so I was very disappointed and in the exam I
  got a 6. I ended up giving up, it wasn't those communications that interested me. I was interested
  in communications with a more top-down view, not so much hardware, so much physics,
  because I didn't have the slightest electronic training. Therefore, for me programming boards was
  not, in fact, my calling. But I thought there was a very interesting perspective in communications and
  10 years later communications are a world. I really like the communications area.



  Later, I invested in the area of formal specification, it was also too theoretical for my head. I
  ended up doing my specialization with Professor Zé Nuno, for whom I have great admiration, but, in
  fact, that is a world, a very theoretical level. It's good for Luís Soares Barbosa and Olga Pacheco,
  who are brilliant at things, but not for me. I am more earthy
  earth, I need to move it. I like systems administration, I like thinking about projects, how to set up
  a new computing system, distributed systems, Cluster systems (here at
  Computer Center, we were one of the first centers to have a Cluster), I like to design the systems,
  think about them, then I like to get my hands dirty, in terms of systems programming,
  configuration. Now making programs in C no longer does that. I have a lot of admiration
  for good programmers. I usually say that programming is easy, being a good programmer is very difficult. T
  As I'm not a good programmer, I think it's better to stay in the pits and not program. I know how to
  program, but I program poorly and I don't like it, it causes me a lot of stress.


  In professional terms, I think I'm in the right place. I think I have some management and project
  coordination skills. I think, to be very honest, that I have some gaps in terms of knowledge. I think
  I needed to invest a lot in self-training at the moment, because things move very fast in IT. We
  live in the IT Center, each in our own store, each in our chapel with our employees. Therefore, I
  was in the Unix area and my specialization was that, I had my employees. The other was in
  communications and lived closed in that world. The other was from Windows and lived in that
  world. Okay, Unix is an area
Machine Translated by Google
 very interesting, but that's not what computing is about. I've always really liked communications and I always thought we
 all had to work together and we had to have an integrated project. Today in
 Today, large servers no longer make sense, even Unix systems. Microcomputers are beginning to beat large
 computers in terms of performance. Therefore, it was necessary to break with this logic and create a transversal service,
 in which there was some coherence in terms of areas, but where things worked very interconnected. I finally managed to
 convince people that, in fact, this would be the best way to work, but it was difficult. It was necessary to break with
 something
 tradition, break with the resistance that people have to leaving their domain, where they rule, where they have their
 subordinates.



  On the one hand, I feel a bit harmed because I was always forced to be in that area and ended up missing out on all the
  IT transformation that was taking place on the other side. This has evolved in terms of communications, in terms of
  information services. Therefore, I was a bit penalized in that aspect. Then, as I had that health problem, I was very
  late. Although I'm following along, because I have a lot of experience and hear a few things here and there and talk a lot to
  a lot of people who know a lot, at this point I needed to invest in self-education.

  I needed to stop and say this:



  -"Now I'm going to be in my office for three months, I don't do anything other than study."



  I have some difficulty technically keeping up with people. I feel that, at the moment, I have little technical competence
  to technically monitor the people under my responsibility.




  We are currently working with an IT consultant, who is very good and who has given us enormous support. We also need
  to have the humility to recognize that we are not capable and need to seek external support, so we resorted to this
  solution, which I think was very good. This does not mean that I do not have the capacity to monitor, but rather to
  intervene
  I have little technique at the moment.



  In professional terms, what I really wanted was to see the new IT Center grow, because I think we have a fantastic
  project. Let's start providing quality services to our users. We are still in the first phase of implementation, we have a long
   way to go.
  I think that from here we will have a quality IT Center. I think we will have the IT Center that we deserve, because if
  there's one thing I can say, it's that I've always been very involved with the work. And this house has a lot of me, in
  terms of working hours, emotional involvement, in terms of intellectual involvement. Therefore, I often did without
  my family to help the IT Center, that is, the IT Center is more than a second home. My family complains that I live
  more at the IT Center than

  at home. I think I inherited my father's sense of responsibility and, in fact, this has a lot to do with me, as well as a lot
  with my colleagues and everyone who works here. I think people deserve a high-quality, modern IT Center. Then we
  have many employees that we need to make profitable, who are not accounted for, but who are not put on the shelf, they
  have their role to play, but at the moment we still cannot, let's say, reach the stage where we are going to train them and
  we are going to put them into action on the ground. This costs a lot and has not yet been resolved. We have many
  hours of work ahead of us.




  In terms of projects, I've been thinking about this for many years, if things went very well, but I don't think they will go as
  well as that, I think that a computer center should be set up in a
Machine Translated by Google
  university in one of the Portuguese-speaking African countries: Cape Verde, S. Tomé, Mozambique.
  But I think that for this you need to have a lot of technological competence. You don't do these
  things to make money, nor to gain prestige. Basically, it was a dream, one that I've had for a long
  time, but I don't think I ever felt prepared for it.




  I have some dreams, in personal terms, it's going to Africa. That's my big dream. I would like to go
  to Africa and have time to achieve this goal.


  Africa fascinates me: perhaps the sun, the sea, the black men, the black women. I have always had a
   great fascination with Africa. I think it has to do with the people I met. I lived with a lot of African
  people and, in fact, I have a fascination with those people. The sun is something that attracts me a
  lot, the sea too and African culture also attracts me a lot. Therefore, I am fascinated by Africa.


  ## Maturity: new perspectives ##



  How do I describe my life? When I look back... I don't know... I think if I had the opportunity I
  would change some things, maybe I would change the way I was in life. I think maturity is an
  interesting thing because it gives us a different perspective on things. I think, perhaps, I had
  adopted a different stance. I probably wouldn't have worked so hard at work, I would have taken
  things more calmly. Maybe I would have been less emotionally involved, maybe I would have
  been able to do a better job with less wasted energy. I think it's a character problem that I have,
  I waste a lot of energy because I get too involved and I think, frankly, that that's not the best way
  to work. Therefore, I think
  I also made some mistakes in terms of work methodology, which also hurt me.
  I think I can boast of some personal merit, in terms of work, but I also have some things that I
  did wrong and that I would like to correct, because I think I did it wrong and if I had had an attitude
  different, maybe I would have done more and used less energy.


  Do I feel satisfied? I think the evil of the public service starts with salaries because people are paid
  too little, they work a lot and earn very little. So I think this leads to
   a situation in which, in fact, one is only satisfied in the public service when one is a bad
  public servant, that is, when one does not work. When you work, it doesn't pay off because you
  work a lot and earn very little. There are many hours of work, then the end of the month comes and there is
  to go out to dinner with the family. This is very damaging to people's lives, especially people
  who dedicate themselves to work. Therefore, on that side I cannot feel satisfied, even now
  As head of division I feel satisfied. It's clear that I earn a reasonable salary, but if I compare it
  to people who work in the private sector, they have less responsibilities than me and earn less.
  double in the best of calm. From that point of view, I think I actually feel very dissatisfied.


  Regarding my personal life, I don't think I can complain, but I also can't say that I feel
  completely fulfilled and satisfied, far from it, I feel reasonable. I still have a lot to achieve. Satisfaction is something that is
  achieved day by day. Therefore, I am not satisfied because I think I have not yet achieved the goals that life set for me. But
  the balance is positive. @corpus\JoseMoreira.md # Interview with José Manuel Branco Marado Moreira
Machine Translated by Google


  ## José Moreira ##




  My name is José Manuel Branco Marado Moreira. I was born here in Braga, in S.Vitor, on the 16th of June
  from 1950.



  ## "Very curious origin" ##




  My father's name is José Moreira Rodrigues and my mother is Irene Branco de Almeida Marado. My grandfather
  My paternal name was Auspício Rodrigues and my grandmother was Maria da Conceição Moreira. My maternal grandfather
  was Manuel Carneiro da Cunha Marado and my grandmother was Maria da Conceição Duarte de Almeida.




  My father was from Braga and my mother was from Cêtos. My mother came to study in Braga, met my father and
  the result was 8 children. Regarding the origin of my grandparents, well, my paternal grandfather has a very curious
  origin. My paternal grandmother was from Ermída, a village in Serra do Gerês. My paternal grandfather, and this is
  why my grandfather is Rodrigues and we are not, was Italian and fled here during the First World War. So I couldn't get a
  job here in Portugal because I wasn't Portuguese. One day, he and a friend, a Mr. Rodrigues, went to Alentejo for the
  weekend. Meanwhile, Mr. Rodrigues had one of those illnesses

  suddenly and died. Then my grandfather, who was Cottinelli, said that Cottinelli, who was actually the director of the
  "Song of Lisbon" and the architect who created the Monument of Discoveries, had died, and he was the Portuguese.
  And so, my grandfather adopted the name Rodrigues and stopped using Cottinelli. For this reason, my father only
  signs José Moreira and none of us, the 8 brothers, have the surname Rodrigues. This is the origin of my paternal
  grandfather. My maternal grandmother was from a village near Castro d'Aire, Moura Morta. My maternal grandfather
  was from a village in the Serra de Monte Mouro, which is Cêtos. All humble people, hardworking people, people with
  a spirit of sacrifice, something that today
  day is already a bit scarce.



  I have some memories of my grandparents, I remember that as a child we lived more with our maternal grandparents,
  but, above all, with our maternal grandfather. Although we lived in Braga, we often went to the village for long holidays,
  up there, we ran the entire mountain from one end to the other.
  Firstly, it was good for us, because we were free, and it was good for my parents because they were free from some
  of us. There were many of us and at that age of mischief... Those were times.



  My maternal grandfather was a primary school teacher, and I remember I went to 4th grade with him. He came to Braga
  on Christmas vacation, and said this to my mother:



  -"Look, he doesn't know anything! Let him go upstairs with me, so he can do 4th grade."



  And I went. In fact, my parents took advantage because there was one less child at home. So I did 4th grade up there
  with my grandfather. But I have very good memories, very good experiences of past adventures in Cêtos, of living
  with those humble people. It was a small community village, where there wasn't a locked door at that time. Now there is,
  but at that time all the
Machine Translated by Google
  We had the door open. Everyone called each other uncle, it was as if they were all part of the same family. This contributed
  to creating a relationship of friendship and solidarity between all people, which was absolutely unusual and curious. It was
  something that marked me since I was a kid, it was this feeling of friendship and solidarity. Always being ready and
  willing to help anyone comes from that time, because since I was little, I would spend part of the year, let's say month and

  half, two months, with my maternal grandparents in the village, where that was the type of life. I mean, everything was
  practically in the same family, everyone got along well, the doors were open to everyone. Nobody lacked anything, because
  if one had less and the other had more, everything worked. These were things that were ingrained in me and,
  therefore, from a very young age I have been guided by
  for these values and these principles.



  To characterize my father, I must say that he is a person with an extraordinary capacity for work, an extraordinary
  intellectual capacity, but on a very austere level and very "I'm in charge here". But either way, we are 8 brothers, and I'm
  practically the only one who has a 'sibling' relationship with him, so to speak. My father and I get along quite well. We are
  both deeply connected to the Obra de Maria movement, which has placed us in a very close relationship of brotherhood.




  I accompanied my father to work, in fact, I was the only one who walked with my father everywhere. I went with him
  wherever he went. This relationship with my father has always been very important to me, since I was a child. It still remains
  today. It is a relationship of trust, friendship and total dedication,
  or willingness to help with whatever is needed. The relationship my father has with me is totally different from the
  relationship he has with any of my brothers.



  The tasks at home were distributed, so my father always worked, he always had several activities to support the entire family.
  My father worked at the National Labor Institute, at Mocidade Portuguesa, he was linked to Mocidade Portuguesa for a long
  time, where he also had a part-time job. Therefore, he worked during the day at the National Labor Institute, in the late
  afternoon at Mocidade Portuguesa, and at night at Correio do Minho. He became editor-in-chief of Correio do Minho. In
  fact, I remember spending many nights with him at Correio do Minho. When the war broke out in Angola, in 1961, I remember
  those chronicles that the news agencies broadcast to the newspapers. It was necessary to record that with those obsolete
  materials from 40 years ago, it was complicated to do that work. I remember that work perfectly, the composing work,
  the machines working to make the newspaper.




  Regarding my father's activity, as commercial manager of the bookstore, I remember that I was 13/14 years old when my
  father and a group of people from Braga, linked to cultural and intellectual circles, decided to
  create a bookstore, which was Livraria, Editora Pax, Lta., on Rua do Souto. This bookstore started from a stationery store
  that had already existed in the city for many years, which was acquired by the society, of which my father was a member.
  There were 7/8 members, who dedicated themselves, through their knowledge of Portuguese writers, to publishing books
  by Portuguese authors. The business developed
  and grew a lot.



  Livraria-Editorial was known in several areas of the country and had contacts with the country's major publishers. Livraria-
  Editora Pax existed for around 35 years, here in Braga, on Rua do Souto, which ended up being dissolved due to the
  increase in new cities and new shopping centers.



  The bookstore did not go bankrupt, it never went bankrupt. First, the typography and bookbinding business ended, which
  were where the Garanjinhos Shopping Center is now. Editota Pax was on Rua do Souto and the workshops
Machine Translated by Google
  typography and bookbinding facilities extended to the back of Rua do Souto, which led
  precisely to the Garanjinhos Shopping Center area. Therefore, at that time, there was administrative
  possession of those lands by the City Council to build the shopping center.
  I remember that, at that time, printing and bookbinding were going to cease to exist, therefore,
  the employees, the workers of around 25, would go into unemployment. My father, within this line of
  guidance, of predisposition to solving people's problems, managed to resolve the situation of
  employees and at the same time the situation of society itself, managing to reach an agreement
  with the City Council:


  - "Yes, sir, you keep this, we put an end to the typography and binding activity, but
  the City Council keeps all the machines and all the staff for Editora Correio do Minho."


  Therefore, he saved the jobs of all employees who would become unemployed and safeguarded
  the interests of society by transferring all the machinery to the City Council, avoiding the
  sale of all those machines for scrap.


  As famous and regular customers of the bookstore, I remember clearly people with whom my father
  related, due to the activities, not only because they were good friends of my father, but also
  because they were collaborators, writers, with whom we had a relationship. I remember, for example,
  of Dr. Domingos Monteito, who has already died, and who was a writer; by Dr. Armando César; by
  Dr. Pinharanda Gomes; by Dr.Carlos da Cunha, several people who were clients had written books,
  which Pax had published. Then there was the society, which was quite large. There were a
  lot of partners and I remember that most of the partners were my father's age and, therefore, had
  children, who were our age, and with whom we had friendly relationships. For example, when I went
  by bike from Póvoa do Varzim to Esposende, I went to the house of some friends of ours, who
  were the children of one of my father's partners at Pax. There was a friendly relationship between us.




  My father was part of the founding committee of ASPA, which is 25 years old. ASPA was initially
  CODEP, unless I'm mistaken, and in those first years my father wasn't connected, but later he
  joined. He joined the committee by invitation. He was always a person with an appetite for all
  things that related to cultural heritage. In fact, my father has always been linked to culture, just
  look at his own entry into Pax society, to writing, literature, but also to everything that is cultural heritage.
  For example, Braga is a city that has many monuments, unfortunately a lot of things have
  been destroyed. Let's save what's possible!


  The objective of ASPA, as an association for the defense of cultural heritage, is precisely to alert the
  public opinion for various things, such as, for example, for the preservation of monuments,
  important to the city's culture, which say something about the way people lived in the past.


  ASPA has some publications, every fortnight it has a page in the Diário do Minho, where
  articles are published on topics that concern heritage. Generally, every fifteen days,
  On Mondays, the second page of Diário do Minho is "Entre Aspas", which is from ASPA. It
  publishes an annual magazine of articles on various topics and then provides guided tours to
  everyone, both members and non-members.


  As for my mother, she was always a woman with extraordinary working capacity. In fact, I
Machine Translated by Google
  I remember, when I was a kid, my mother was a social worker and was in charge of many Casas do Povo, in the
  Braga area, such as: Lago, Pico de Regalado, Rulães, Arcos de Valdevez, Fafe, Arões . She often went to work and took
  three children with her: one by her hand, another on her lap and the third in her belly. So my mother was a hard worker. Now
  she's retired, she's still here, fortunately, but she was a working Moor, which resulted in a very diverse family. We are all quite
  different in terms of temperament, temperament, character, but

  When it comes to getting together we are all ready, like three musketeers "one for all and all for one". That's what really
  sticks with us, when it comes to batting we're all united.



  ## Jumping from house to house ##




  I don't have any great memories of the house where I was born, I know it was here in Braga, on Rua de S. Victor.
  Although they tell me about episodes from my childhood, when I was 2 years old, I don't have any great
  memories. In fact, we lived in the house where I was born for very little time. I was born in that house, but after a year we
  were in another. The brother who was born after me, who is a year and a half younger than me, was born elsewhere. So, from
  then on, we kept moving from home because the family grew and the house also had to grow, otherwise no one would fit
  there. So I don't remember the house. I remember some episodes, for example, on Rua de S. Victor, a few years ago, the
  tram passed by, coming from Bom Jesus and going to Turismo, Banco de Portugal, then heading down to Maximinos.
  So, every day, my father took the tram and went to work. I didn't know where his work was, but I knew he went on the tram.
  So, they tell me that one day, I was about a year and a half old, I had recently learned to walk, and they found me next to
  the Arcada, at the Banco de Portugal. I had walked along the street outside the tram and it was a lady, who later became
  the godmother of one of my sisters, who met me in the middle of the tram line and said to me:




  - "Oh Zé Manel, what are you doing here?"



  I said I was going to meet my dad at work. I mean, I never got there again, but I went to see him.



  I remember best the house where my brothers began to be born, starting with the third brother. We lived on Avenida da
  Liberdade, in those Social Security buildings, in a house on the corner of Avenida da Liberdade, formerly Avenida Marchal
  Gomes da Costa, with the highway that goes to Porto.
  I still remember us going to live there, I was 3 and a half years old. I remember that, at that time, there was no highway
  yet, the exit to Porto was through the station. It had a little dead end. AND
  I remember that when my father came home from work, on summer afternoons, we would go play football and play in the
  back of the house because there was no problem, there was no traffic. It was a normal house. I don't remember exactly
  now, but I think it had two bedrooms, a kitchen, two bathrooms, one of them small, a large living room, a common room,
  a dining room with a large common room. I remember playing football with my father in the living room. I, my parents and my
  brothers lived in that house. I remember that I, Luís, Miguel, Fernando and Leonor lived in that house. We lived in that
  house until the fifth brother, then when the sixth was born (we are four boys in a row and then three girls and then a boy to
  finish, who is the "rapa-tacho"), the second of the girls, therefore, the sixth child , was born on Avenida 31 de Janeiro.
  Therefore, I was born in S.Victor, my next brother was born in Guadalope. We went to live in a house in the Guadalope
  area. Then the third, fourth and fifth were born on Avenida da Liberdade. Isabel, who is the sixth, was born on Avenida 31
  de Janeiro, Cecília and João, who are the last, were born on Rua Bernardo Sequeira, where my father and I live. He lives at nº
  454, on the upper side of the Highway, and I live on the lower side. We are so close, but to go to each other's houses or
  walk, and

  We have to pass the plane ticket, or we have to go around the city.



  ## "Family Christmas and Easter" ##




  The most memorable moments for my family were, without a doubt, the Christmas and Easter gatherings, when my
  grandparents were with us. My grandparents came from Cêtos to spend a few days with us.
  I remember at Easter time my grandfather came to our house because he liked to watch the Holy Week ceremonies,
  I had already attended 4th grade in the village with my grandfather, I must have been 12/13 years old, and bring gifts.
  One year I brought a baby goat and then Jesus! Those younger brothers of mine, oh my Our Lady, gave the little goat
  a party:



  - "Oh, what a beautiful little goat!"



  My grandfather had brought the goat for Easter lunch. So the family used to watch all the Maundy Thursday and Good
  Friday processions. I remember that my grandfather and I agreed that we wouldn't go to the procession because he was
  sick. So everyone went to the procession and the two of us were left alone. My grandfather had experience and I was always
  ready to help with these
  things, so we killed the goat and put it in the fridge. When they arrived the kid was in the fridge. They cried like that, they
  got angry with us, but that passed.



  ## "Very quiet" ##




  Of the family activities, I remember when I was a kid, between 7 and 10 years old, going to football with my friend.
  my father because he was a correspondent for Comércio do Porto and Jornal de Notícias and had to report on the games.
  So we went with him to watch the games.



  As for weekend getaways, we were a very big family and my mother worked a lot during the week, although we had
  maids at home. We always had so-called "maids". I remember being a kid and we already had a job, practically
  since I was 4/5 years old in
  onwards, because my mother didn't have the chance to work at Casas do Povo, to teach and then come home and make
  lunches, dinners, and everything, it wasn't possible. Then the weekends, at that time, there are
  Forty-odd years, they were all about Sunday. Saturday was a normal work day. Sunday was spent like this: we went to
  mass and catechesis, we were raised like that by my mother, my father wasn't like that much, although he changed after
  a certain point. My father, when I was growing up, was agnostic and didn't care about the church at all. From 1966
  onwards, with the discovery of the Work of Mary, it took a 180º turn.




  -"Your brother is sleeping, if he cries, put the pacifier in, rock him a little."



  I started taking on this responsibility when I was little. I remember always having this notion that my parents were always
  very busy and I was the one who had to look after my siblings.
  I have always been very calm, I have never been given to big mischief, big rushes, big
Machine Translated by Google
  naughty things, those naughty things that kids do. No, I was never a boy to do mischief.



  Regarding the games we played, well, my brothers never played much games with me. I remember we had very
  quiet games. I had an amazing relationship with my brother next to me, Luís, and when we were kids, until I was 6/7
  years old, I called him "you" and he called me "you ". The respect between us was so much that we called each other "you"
  and we called our parents "you". Therefore, there was always a relationship between us of great respect.




  My relationship with my brothers was always good, I don't know their opinion. I'm convinced that any of my
  brothers see me as that older brother, always daddy's favorite boy, they could say that. But my relationship with them has
  always been the best possible.




  As I said, I've never been one for a lot of troubles, a lot of running around with bicycles. In fact, one of the things
  What really impacted me was, when I was a kid, when I was 5/6 years old, we always went to Esposende, to the beach.
  Esposende's coastal avenue didn't exist, it was sandy from one end to the other. I remember, when I was around 4/5 years
  old, when my mother's younger sister went with us to Esposende, she was riding a bike and had a skull fracture. She was
  younger than my mother by 10 years. This left a deep impression on me, from that point onwards, I gained a certain fear of
  rushing.




  I remember when I was 7 years old my father gave me a bicycle. I walked a lot, but I was always very careful. I remember
  that the bicycle had two wheels at the back, then one of the wheels broke, so it only had one wheel on one side and I
  ended up learning to ride a bike by myself because one of them broke. I remember, for example, being 13/14 years old,
  going to Póvoa de Varzim for vacation and going by bike from Póvoa to Esposende, along the road. I came and went. But I
  mean, I took my time, very carefully. At that time, traffic was not what it is today. It was "There

  There's a car", one would come by every half hour. I had my little adventures, but they were little adventures, they
  weren't adventures.



  ## "I already knew how to read" ##




  Until I was 4 years old, I spent a lot of time with my mother and father. From the age of 4 I started attending pre-primary
  education. I remember that I spent some time at Colégio do Bulim, which is in the Igreja do Carmo, and still operates today. I
  also went to D.Pedro V school, which is on Avenida Central, close to Congregados and then I went to S. Lázaro
  primary school, which was relatively close to the house where we lived.




  I walked to school. In fact, my father never had a license, he never wanted to get a driving license and my mother only
  managed it because life was hard and there were so many of us, at the expense of her work. She even wrote a book on
  Domestic Economics. In addition to being a social worker at Casas do Povo, she taught Home Economics classes at the
  Commercial School, at Carlos Amarante and even wrote a book on Home Economics, which at that time was adopted
  as the only book. It was from then on that my mother was able to get her driving license and buy a car. I was 13 or 14 years old
  when my mother got her license and bought a car, a Volkswagem, which in German means "the people's car", that really was
  the "people's car".

  The school was relatively close to home, from Avenida da Liberdade to the S. Lázaro school is close,
  although we later moved, but I always walked to school. In fact, when I started attending Sá de
  Miranda high school, we lived on Rua Bernardo Sequeira, where the university's old facilities were,
  and I always walked. I always came and went on foot. I would go at 9 am, have lunch at 12:30 pm, return
  at 2 pm and always walk home, whether it was raining or sunny.


  I started primary school when I was 6 years old. I already knew how to read when I went to school
  because I spent a lot of time with my father and mother and there were buses, buses, trams passing
  by and there were signs saying "Go to the Bridge", "Go to Monte d'Arcos" and I would ask to my father
  and mother: - "What's that tram? What does it say there?", - "It says this, it says that." So I learned to put letter
  so that when I went to school I already knew how to read.



  The school I am referring to is the School of S. Lázaro. The memories I have of school refer, above
  all, to the first teacher I had, who was Professor Vieira. I saw him a few days ago. He is now very
  finished. But I have the idea that Professor Vieira was a very good friend of mine. I also have an idea
  of some colleagues, not many, but some, I still remember them. But what I remember best is that
  teacher and the relationship I had with him, because he liked me a lot and I liked him a lot. I was
  always very attentive in class. I remember once coming home very sad.
  I had taken the passing test, I don't know if it was from 2nd to 3rd, from 3rd to 4th and I took the test
  home. I arrived home very sad. I gave the proof to my father and said:


  -"Oh dad, sorry, I only got 20 this year, but next year I got 40."


  But this also revealed the commitment I had, even at that time, to do everything perfectly.



  From my relationships with my colleagues, I remember that I was always very peaceful, I was always a
  boy who didn't get into big trouble, ever. It wasn't about pranks. I don't know why, perhaps
  due to temperament. I was never one for big jokes, big things, I was always very reserved and very
  cautious and then from... There's something that happened to me, I was very good at playing ball, I
  played very well, I had a knack, I did some " dribbling", some feints. One day I was playing football with
  one of my brothers and friends from the building, I was very good at it, I tricked my brother, and my brother
  He tripped me, without meaning to, he tripped me. Well, that was one of those cobblestone
  terraces, I knocked out my knee, I remember it was new. But from then on I just kicked
  on the ball if no one was next to me within a 10 meter radius. I suffered such trauma, such fear and
  from then on I was always very withdrawn and somewhat afraid of adventures, big rushes, big games,
  ball games and I don't know what else.


  In the past, teaching was very different from today. In the past, let's say, anyone who made a mistake
  in a dictation at school or in their homework would immediately get their hands slapped. Now, what
  was happening? It was very rare for me to make mistakes, firstly because when I arrived at school I already kne
  because since I was a kid my parents knew how to instill in me a love of reading and books. I remember
  storybooks by Sophia de Mello Breyner, Adolfo Simões Müller, and several writers of children's and
  young adult books. I read a lot. Therefore, as I read a lot, I found it easy to write.


  My relationship with teachers was always very good, precisely because I never gave much
Machine Translated by Google
  problems for teachers. That is, teachers never had to worry about me when I didn't understand
  anything. In fact, I had a characteristic: when I had any doubts, I would go to the teacher and until that
  was clarified, I wouldn't rest. Which might not happen to others. So I always had a good relationship with
  any of the teachers. And then, my 4th grade teacher, who was my grandfather Marado, was
  wonderful.


  I don't remember any funny stories that happened during classes. When I went to the village with my
  grandfather, if in Braga they considered me to know nothing or that I knew very little, in the village I
  was the king. If I didn't know anything, then the other poor things... precisely because of their cultural
  level. Most of their parents didn't even know how to read because at that time there wasn't even a
  school, and that had a lot of influence.


  I remember that in that 4th grade, I was with my grandfather in Cêtos, I remember some extra-
  school episodes. At school there was a male part and a female part, because in the past there was
  no mixing. The boys were on one side and the girls on the other. The boys' teacher was my grandfather,
  my mother's father, and the girls' teacher was my aunt, my mother's sister. I remember I was at my
  grandfather's house, where my aunt, my mother's sister, was also there, and there was a girl, who was
  still part of my mother's family, although she was a girl I didn't get along with much. She was older, I
  was 10 years old at that time, and I think she was already 14 and still in 4th grade, so she had already
  failed a few years at least. And the girl had some learning difficulties. And I remember some
  episodes, some jokes that we played, but without malice. Those things we did to make each other
  laugh. For example, I remember at one time, there was a large bench with one leg that was curved, on
  one end I sat and on the other this girl, who was my cousin. I knew that the bench had a curved
  leg, so that when she got up, for example, to get a piece of bread, I would also get up because
  otherwise the bench would fall. But I was always watching when I caught her distracted to get up and
  she fell. He made these jokes, but without malice.



  I went to primary school, then I went to secondary school, and then I attended the Instituto Superior
  de Engenharia. Therefore, I studied until I was ready to join the army, until I was 22 years old. Then I went to the
  When I came back I still thought about going back to school. I was still enrolled at university for a few
  years, on the Computer Systems course, but I ended up dropping out. Firstly, because he was already full of vic
  I was married and then because the teachers weren't very interested in me joining the course
  and taking their place. They would say like this:


  - "Gee, one day Moreira graduates and then he becomes president, he runs with us, takes our place,
  and it's a bummer."


 Regarding what I wanted to be when I grew up, I don't remember ever saying what I would like to be or
 what I wanted to be. I remember that I was 14 years old, at that time I completed the 5th year of high
 school, which is now the 9th year, and having to choose the area I wanted to pursue. I remember at that time
 I chose the Science area for Engineering, but I have the impression that I was wrong, I was better
 suited to some other area other than Engineering. In fact, when you saw the results, I ended up, from the
 10th year onwards, previously it was the 6th year of high school, choosing this area. I was very young,
 At that time I wasn't old enough to know what I really wanted. I chose the Science area and I have
 the impression that I chose poorly. From the 6th year onwards, although I was approved, I never
 I was the student I had been up to that point, perhaps due to my mistake.


  I could have chosen Law, Literature, Law, Teaching, but not the Engineering course, with many
Machine Translated by Google
  Mathematics and Physics. Even though I did well with these subjects until the 5th year, from then on things didn't pick
  up and I ended up wasting a few years. At that time it was also quite difficult to access higher education, it was much
  more difficult than it is now. Although now there are many clauses, and I don't know what else, in the past there was nothing
  like that, but there were entrance exams. That's where they cut off everyone's legs.




  And so, at this point, I don't want to say either yes or no, but I have the impression that I was a bit of a victim of my parents'
  political choices, who always, let's say, didn't really support the regime at the time, although they didn't support it
  either. fully supported, that is, they walked there in a field between
  support for the regime and support for the opposition. They never joined the socialist and communist parties, but
  they also never joined the Old Regime line. Therefore, they always remained there in a status of certain independence
  from the declared political power. There was a time, and it was precisely at the time when I was taking university
  entrance exams, when my fathers were involved in partisan fights, in partisan electoral swings, and they were not
  good for me. Although I cannot say this clearly, I am convinced that yes, I was greatly harmed by the fact that my parents
  had that line at that time.




  I joined the Institute, which is now the Instituto Superior de Engenharia, in Porto, which at that time was the Instituto
  Industrial do Porto, where technical agent courses were taken, it was a secondary course, not a
  higher education. But it gave me, because I was there, the possibility of postponing incorporation. It turned
  out that I went there and didn't adapt to it, and as soon as I failed the first year, the guys immediately called me into the
  army. So I was 22 years old, I had just turned 22, and I went to Caldas da Rainha to recruit. I remember that it was a very
  tough three months because, at that time, the army was a serious thing. Now it's a joke, now it's four months of
  playing. But I remember having three very tough months in Caldas da Rainha. In fact, everything was

  It was tough at that time, the difficulties were many.



  ## "When I was dating it was different" ##




  My wife apparently got along very well with my father's younger brother, my uncle, who I called my older brother, who was
  my younger uncle, got along very well with him. He said to him:




  - "Oh Teresa, you will still be part of my family because I have a nephew."



  My wife just said:



  - "What? Your nephews? I don't want anything to do with them, they're all reguals."



  She pleaded, she thought he was like my brothers, she thought 'if he's the same, I don't want anything to do with him'.
  The fish dies through its mouth. I didn't know her, but she knew me, she was tired of hearing about me and I had no idea
  who she was. One fine day, I was in my father's bookstore and she appeared with my uncle's wife. I hadn't been with my
  aunt yet, I had just arrived recently. I was all worried about the treatments, I was struggling with my arms, my legs... I
  started doing the treatment and my skin by chance... By the time I was supposed to return, I hadn't gotten over it
  yet, it wasn't completely well yet. So if I had gone there again,
Machine Translated by Google
  It wasn't good and it was getting worse. In the end, they ended up being adventures. I was in the bookstore, my aunt arrived
  and Teresinha was coming.



  - "Look, this is my nephew that we told you about. Do you remember us talking about him?"



  - "Oh, is this gentleman?."



  She lived with her grandmother, at my grandmother's house. She had problems with her father and stepmother and then
  they ended up running with his mother and daughter. They went around living in homes, then ended up meeting my
  grandmother, who offered them the house. My grandmother was alone, at that time, in a house right in front of the
  Cathedral and she lived there for a while. It was from there that we met.




  She started working that year. I came from there at that time, so I ended up being here later. I underwent treatment, got well
 and from July 1976, I was unemployed for half a year, I started working at Casa do Povo, first in Barcelinhos, where I spent
  half a year and then managed to transfer here, to the Social Medical Services in Braga. . From January 1977 I started working
 here,
 I no longer had to travel back and forth every day, at that time I went by bus. Then in June
  we got married.




  Dating in the past was nothing like it is now. As I said, I started working in Barcelinhos. I went there first thing in
  the morning, leaving Braga at 8am because I had to be there at 9am, and there was no other means of transport. So in
  the morning I would leave the house, go get the truck, and she would leave her house and go get the truck. But
  before I started working in Barcelinhos, she taught classes in S.Torcato, in the afternoon. I left Braga in a bus around the

  noon, I went to Guimarães and from Guimarães to S. Torcato, arriving at 6:30 am. I remember that in the morning I would
  go from my house, on Rua Bernardo Sequeira, to my grandmother's house, which was on the edge of the Cathedral, I would
  pick her up and stay with her until the bus arrived. Then she went to work. At the end of the afternoon, when she came, we
  always met the grandmothers.



  She couldn't leave her grandmother's side, otherwise, oh Jesus, she... The first time we went to the cinema, her grandmother
  went with us, she didn't let us go alone. My wife still says to this day that her grandmother often said:




  - "Hell, there he is again, ringing the doorbell. He won't let go of the front door."



  It is clear that from a certain point onwards things started to change, when the wedding was more or less in sight, there was
  already the engagement ring. So from then on... play but don't abuse it.



  - "Boys, no kidding there behind the Cathedral. You're going out, but you have to be home at midnight."




  And woe betide us if we weren't home at midnight, that was the end of the work. Okay, so it was like that, it was a
  relationship in which, in the end, we created a relationship, consolidating certain points. Nowadays it's very easy, I think it's
  funny how you can get married today and in three months
Machine Translated by Google
 unmarry.



  ## "We got married in Bom Jesus" ##




  Marriage is a very serious thing. When agreeing to marry my wife, what do I have to think about?




  - "Well, from now on you will stop sleeping on a couch, you will no longer be able to put one leg on each side, you
  will no longer be able to do what you want and you will start living a type of life in common, in which each person
  It has to be the complement of the other."



  Let's say, if the woman works, she has her normal job, like I will, and then I get home and sit down to watch TV with the
  newspaper open, waiting for her to make dinner and then clean the kitchen. If there is no compromise on the part of
  the party, in all that is the person's self-indulgence, selfishness, marriage does not work. I've always been ready to
  help, to make everyone's lives as easy as I can. I don't understand how a person can get married today and get married
  in five weeks, three months from now. There has to be a frame, we have to mold ourselves to each other, because
  it is clear that no couples have the same features, there has to be a frame, that is, an adaptation to each other, so
  that each one knows to what extent you can go, without putting your paw on the partner next to you. There has to be an
  understanding, let's say a know-how sometimes.

  This is very important. Knowing how to say:



  - "Okay, leave it there, now let's do something for you, it's not just me who has the right, you do too."




  This is what young people lack nowadays. Saying like this: "I want a car", "And money?", "Cut yourself
  here, it's cut there." And she's the one who's the one who suffers because she doesn't have money for shoes, for clothes,
  for going to the hairdresser, for buying a microwave. Just because I want a car. Instead of buying
  a car, you want a bigger car. It can't be like that. First the conversation is “You need a car.
  Now let's see if we have the conditions for it, it's not just about cutting left and right." So, we can't continue like
  that...



  So, we got married on June 18th, at Bom Jesus, in Braga. The person who married me was a great friend of mine, who is
  now the Archbishop of Braga, D. João Pires. He was the one who married us, in Bom Jesus. It was a very simple
  wedding. We were twenty or so people: just me, my brothers, I still remember little Cecília, she was 16 years old, my
  parents, my brothers, her father and stepmother, her grandmother arranged a scene and it wasn't At the wedding, her
  brother was also present, who at that time was 13 years old.
  I also invited my mother's younger sister, the one who had a skull fracture in Esposende,
  My uncles, on my father's side, with whom I was very close and visited many times, have already died. I have
  always been very attached to my family. It was a simple wedding. Afterwards we had lunch at the Hotel do Elevador. I
  still have the bill at home, I think it was 800 escudos per person, with lunch, those starters. But the prices were nothing
  like today's prices.



  I currently live with my wife and my son here in Braga, at Rua Bernardo Sequeira, nº 99.

  ## "I have a son" ##




  I have a son called Rui Ângelo, he will be 22 years old in April. He studies Law at the University of Minho, in his 3rd year. He
  is the president of the Popular Youth, CDS-PP, Christian Democracy Party.



  ## "From Overseas to the University of Minho" ##




  I left my parents' house when I went to Ultramar, when I joined the troops. When I was 19/20 years old I went to the military
  inspection and was approved for the army. The only thing that wasn't approved was anyone who didn't have the right
  finger to shoot. These were free. My concern was higher education, because if I was studying at an education level that was
  considered secondary or higher, I could ask for a postponement of my military incorporation, which is what happened, even
  though I failed the university entrance exam, perhaps because of reasons I have already mentioned or perhaps not.




  Regarding my time with the troops, I was first in Caldas da Rainha, I was in Lisbon. My daily life as a recruit was like
  this: at 6am the dawn would ring and woe betide anyone who didn't get out of bed straight away. When they couldn't play
  that at 3 in the morning and everyone had to come to the parade, for the graduation. It was getting up at 6 am and starting
  first thing in the morning with physical exercises, exercises of this, exercises of that. There were some theoretical
  classes, but very few. The food was
  very bad. The salary was 3 escudos, we reached the end of the month... My first salary in the army was 3 escudos and to
  receive the 3 escudos we had to shine our boots and put on a nice uniform. Just to put on a nice uniform and polished
  boots would cost 5 escudos and receive 3. A well-groomed beard, otherwise the "nail" would be for them. It was the
  "nail" as they called it. But it was a hard day in the army, so much so that when we reached the end of the day we fell into
  bed and 10 minutes later we were asleep. We went to bed around 10pm, at that time everything was blown up, no one
  could do it anymore.




  I remember some funny episodes from the time I was in the army, for example: we had a lot of physical running exercises.
  First, it was spending the whole day with a 7kg machine gun on top of us, either hanging from our arm or knitted. Then,
  after a certain age, I started to have a problem with my left leg, in the left knee area, so there were exercises, such as
  jumping, which, due to my physical limitations, I was unable to do. But I remember that we had a running exercise in
  which we then had some obstacles, one of the obstacles was a big hole in the ground, but with a width of more
  than 2 meters, I couldn't jump over it at all. It turns out that it was evidence of his time as a recruit.



  I remember before taking the test seeing that and saying:



  - "Well, I'm not going to be able to jump that. What am I going to do when I get there?"



  Okay, I started running and ran at my own pace, at the pace I could handle, and when I reached the edge of that
  obstacle I started to slow down and my company commander, who knew perfectly well the limitations I had, shouted very
  loudly at me. :



  - "Jump in there."
Machine Translated by Google

  And I jumped into the hole. Then they took me out of there. So it was something I wasn't going
  to be able to do, they knew perfectly well that I wasn't going to do it.


  I ended up being recruited, perhaps due to the psychotechnical tests I had taken. My specialty
  was transmission recognition, which was a specialty that would give me the possibility of never
  having to go into the woods or even fire shots or dismantle mines, but always be in a quiet
  place listening to the transmissions that were being made, listening to some of them that were in
  code, which would later have to be decoded, and it was we, those in my specialty, who did this
  service.


  Well, after recruiting in Caldas da Rainha, I went to the transmission recognition specialty, which
  was in Trofaria, in the south of the Tagus, in the Caparica area. Well, I had to go there, I was lucky
  because I had several uncles, my mother's brothers, who lived in Lisbon, so I had support nearby.
  I was there for nine months, in 1973, practically from the 1st of January until the end of September
  1973. I deliberately didn't get a good grade in my specialties, I did it on purpose to go
  overseas. I would like to go to Mozambique where I was lucky enough to go. This is because
  I had a great friend of mine, here in Braga, who was Mozambican and who told me a lot
  about Mozambique, he told me that Mozambique was a splendid land. I was always anxious and
  eager to get to know Mozambique, which really is a fabulous land, with a wealth of cultures, a
  wealth of everything... A country that left a deep impression on me, and that is deeply engraved in my hear
  only Mozambique and Angola.


  Angola is a country where I spent a short time, I was practically only there for a few hours on a
  plane, in Luanda, but where I have many friends. In fact, my godmother, who is my mother's
  sister, and her family lived in Angola for a few years. I have a lot of friends there, so they are two
  countries that are deeply in my heart.


  I went to Mozambique in October 1973. The trip was made by plane because I went in individual
  surrender, I was going to replace someone who was leaving. So I didn't go with companies,
  precisely because of the specialty I had. There were sniper companies, engineering
  companies, etc., but in my case I went for transmission reconnaissance, which was quite small
  and elite, there were just half a dozen more. There were a few in Nampula, in Vila Cabral, a few
  there and a few here. There were two or three of us in each place.


  At first I went to Vila Cabral. There was a barracks there. In fact, the transmission recognition post
  in Vila Cabral, not only in Vila Cabral, but also in other places, was outside the barracks. It was a
  small house, although it was linked to the troops, but it was outside the barracks, precisely because
  of the transmission interference that could have occurred. Me and the guys, there were maybe 12
  of us at the most, we lived there in that house. Meals were brought from the barracks, we had all the
  radios there to listen to, all those things and we couldn't leave there. We worked in shifts. I mean,
  we had to be on top of the event 24 hours a day. There were always people listening to the
  transmissions at night, in the early hours of the morning, and during the day, that is, everything worked in


  The house where we slept had a small room with bunk beds. The house happened to be very funny.
  We had two little black boys, who lived with us and took care of our clothes, washed the
  dishes, the plates were made of aluminum. We also had puppies, which were from "Charat".

  Regarding my day-to-day life, I and another colleague of mine, who had a higher rank,
  were the ones who coordinated the actions of... The hierarchy was as follows: there was an
  ensign, who was the boss, then there were two "couriers ", which was me and another colleague
  of mine, I was responsible for the security of our transmissions, then there was also the
  interception of transmissions from Fretilin, from the enemy, my colleague was responsible. So,
  below us, we had the cables, which were the ones that did the work of picking up the morse
  transmissions and decoding it all. Then our job, mine and my colleague's, was to collect
  everything, put it on paper and send it to the general headquarters, in Nampula.


  The Vila Cabral barracks was close by, 800 meters away, 1 km at most. The work we did all came
  to Nampula, which was more than 0.5 km away. We passed the information we collected to
  the Vila Cabral barracks, and then it was sent from the Vila Cabral barracks. So the work was
  as follows: we collected the information, decoded it all
  and then we sent everything in code to the Vila Cabral barracks, and the Vila Cabral barracks sent
  everything in code to the general headquarters in Nampula, and in Nampula it was decoded
  according to our codes. It was like that. We always worked on Sundays. We didn't have free time,
  we always had work. There was a duty roster, there was a certain rotation, there was always
  someone who was off work. Weekend service was reduced, so there was a service roster.


  In the time I had free, there were times when I wrote to a lot of people, not only at home but also
  to friends. I had a lot of contacts with people there in Mozambique, in fact, during vacation
  times, I went to visit some people I knew in Dondo, in the Beira area, in "Climano", in
  "Bucuva". In the end, I still met a lot of people from Mozambique, Corongosa Park, I even got to
  walk there. I got to know some interesting areas of Mozambique.


  During the period I was in Mozambique, as a recruit, I didn't have time to get to know the city. It
  was such a small town, so small. We lived with the local community, we got along well. Our service
  did not take up much time. For example, I sat in front of the desk
  at the end of dinner and between 9am and 0am, he did all the work and was delivered the next
  morning to go to Nampula. So I had the rest of the day free, although I couldn't leave the
  staff.


  The military did not have activities with the local community, because there was a lot of distrust at
  that time. Not all of the population distrusted the troops, but the majority did. So they already had
  that feeling of autonomy and they felt that the troops were there to stop the liberation
  movements, which they naturally supported because they were theirs and we were not. Therefore, most
  of the population, not all of it, but the majority of the population did not trust the
  Portuguese troops precisely because of this. There were no difficulties in following their
  cultural manifestations, but at those times they spoke in dialect, which we weren't supposed to understand


  At that time, people lived on pure and simple subsistence. Apart from a certain class, already
  more evolved, most people had no culture, no education, no nothing. In other words, they had no
  access to newspapers, they dedicated themselves to subsistence agriculture, raising cattle,
  their "machamba". The little field they had around their house was the "machamba". It was
  curious, black girls with those hairstyles that looked like little rectangles. They called these
  hairstyles "machanba". It was just like what they did in the fields they had around their house. That
  was the kind of life they had.


  As for my return from Mozambique, after perhaps half a year the 25th of April occurred, and the
Machine Translated by Google
  From then on we were left hanging for a while, we didn't even know what they were going to do to us, if they were going to
  send us away, if they were going to leave us there alone. As I really liked that land, Mozambique, I decided to stay
  there, also due to my characteristics, my desire to help. This was more or less in May 1975. No troops remained there. I
  stayed there because a few days before I was scheduled to leave, because I had no other alternative, I heard an advertisement
  on the radio asking for teachers to teach Electricity, Physics and Chemistry, which were subjects related to what I knew.
  They asked for teachers for the first years of secondary education. I said it like this:




  - "Oh man, here's an opportunity for me to stay here."


  In fact, I knew that in Portugal everything was upside down. From April 25, 1974 it was pandemonium. So
  the year 1975! I knew this because my father told me in letters about the difficulties he had. My father even
  forced friends of his to leave the country because they were nicknamed
  fascists. In the midst of that confusion, he said:


  - "Here's an opportunity for me to stay here."


  I applied, they accepted and I said:


  - "I'm not going to Portugal anymore. I'm staying here."



  The school I worked at was in Nampula. The troops, from September 1974, were deactivated in Vila Cabral,
  and we all came to Nampula, which was the center where the general headquarters were. Then everything
  went away. I ended up staying in Nampula for a while longer. Then I ended up getting an apartment for
  myself. I was there alone. But Mozambique's independence was in June, at the time of S. João, in June
  1975. From then on I became a foreigner in Mozambique because I
  he was Portuguese. Until then I was in a land that belonged to Portugal, then from that point on I
  became a foreigner. And I remember that on the night of independence, June 25th, and on the night of June
  24th to 25th, I no longer had anything to do with the troops, the Portuguese troops had already ceased
  to exist, but they knew that I had been part of the "Sheique" that I was in the military and was
  involved in the transmissions, in the codes, and it got into their heads... I know that I spent the night from
  the 24th to the 25th with two guys, inside my home, machine gun in hand and they wouldn't let me go
  anywhere. From then on they started to walk on top of me a bit. Although, as I always did, I went from
  home to school, taught the classes I had to teach, returned home and left little else.


  Every now and then I would go for a walk there. Nampula was already a bigger city and so on, I spoke to
  some people, I already had some friends. But they went on to score. On the other hand, the situation
  began to worsen significantly in terms of gender. I spent a lot of time there and I don't even want to know
  because there was practically no more fish, meat or fresh vegetables, there was only canned food.


  I know that I came from there in December, I originally came to spend holidays here in Potugal.
  Therefore, an academic year there was unlike here, it ended in December, which was precisely the hot
  month, so in my time it ended at that time. I remember, I made the trip to come spend 30 days on vacation
  in Portugal, in Braga, at home with my family. I left there on December 7, 1975, on the night of December 7
  to 8, 1975, it was precisely the night that Indonesia invaded Timor. It was a plane ride from there to here,
  but one thing, at that time we had everything cut off. They
Machine Translated by Google
  They didn't let everything that belonged to the Portuguese... We left Beira at 9:30 pm and the trip
  that was made was: Beira-Nairobi which is a bit higher up. We should have arrived in Nairobi around half past midnight
  to make a technical stop on the plane. They didn't let us off the plane. We spent maybe two hours standing in Nairobi, at
  Nairobi airport, on the plane. We ended up leaving Nairobi as the sun was already appearing, it must have been around 4:30
  in the morning, the day starts very early there.
  We left Nairobi and crossed the whole of Africa in parallel, because there were countries that did not allow us to fly over
  their airspace and that is why the trip was made from Beira to Nairobi, which is at the tip of Africa, and then Nairobi to
  Libreville, in Gabon, which is at the tip of here on the edge of Guinea. So we crossed all of Africa in parallel.
  We left Nairobi at 4:30 in the morning, we crossed Africa
  one end to the other, a journey that took 4 hours by plane, in which we should have arrived at more or less 9 am. We landed
  in Libreville, Gabon, for another technical stopover. They didn't let us get off the plane again, we stayed in the plane for
  another two hours. We ended up arriving in Lisbon, I remember that we arrived in Lisbon at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I
  remember because the plane passes over the Restelo stadium and the teams were entering the field for the football
  game, which was a Sunday.




  December 8th was a Sunday. Well, then, I arrived here and I had an infection, a skin disease, my skin was falling apart
  due to a lack of vitamins from meat, fish, eggs, fresh vegetables because the only thing there was to eat it was preserves
  and condensed milk, because there wasn't even fresh milk. There were preserves like combat rations, which were left
  over from the troops, so there were three combat rations for the entire week. She was so hungry for that brave one. I got here,
  my mother was throwing a fit when she saw me.




  - "Hey how come you!!!"



  I came with untied shoes because I couldn't put my feet in there, everything was sore. Then, I got here and started to
  be treated. I remember the doctor who treated me, Dr.
  Sousa Bastos, who is well known as a skin doctor here in Braga. Okay, so I came with 30 days of leave, with a round trip,
  the way I got here, my parents barely saw me and said: -




  - "It's over, you're not going anymore."



  And it's over. I started working in January 1977 at the Medical Social Services here in Braga. From January 1977 to February
  1982, until February 12th, I worked in the Social Medical Services. On February 15, 1982, I came to the University of Minho, to
  the Informatics Center.




  ## Memoirs ##




  I remember some funny episodes from the time I was in the army, for example: we had a lot of physical running exercises.
  First, it was spending the whole day with a 7kg machine gun on top of us, either hanging from our arm or knitted. Then, after
  a certain age, I started to have a problem with my left leg, in the left knee area, so there were exercises, such as jumping,
  which, due to my physical limitations, I was unable to do. But I remember that we had a running exercise in which we
  then had some obstacles, one of the obstacles was a big hole in the ground, but with a width of more than 2
  meters, I didn't

 There was no way I could skip that. It turns out that it was evidence of his time as a recruit.
  I remember before taking the test seeing that and saying:



  - "Well, I'm not going to be able to jump that. What am I going to do when I get there?"



  Okay, I started running and ran at my own pace, at the pace I could handle, and when I reached the edge of that

  And I jumped into the hole. Then they took me out of there. So it was something I wasn't going to be able to do,
  they knew perfectly well that I wasn't going to do it.



  ## The fascination of IT ##




  I entered the University of Minho through a competition. A competition opened by Professor Valença, who was the head
  of the IT department, in Computing Services, as it was called at that time.
  I saw the ad in Comércio do Porto and applied. I and another boy came in, who is no longer working here. Two of us
  entered at that time.



  We took on the role of operator, in the IT Center, which at that time was a very rudimentary thing. There was a small
  computer, let's say it was a micro-computer, it would have three or four workstations at that time. The support we
  provided was recording everything on magnetic tapes, taking care of the printers, transferring data from disks to
  floppy disks,
  etc. That was basically it.



  My first day of work at the University of Minho, I no longer remember in great detail, but I'm sure that day was getting in
  touch with the existing machine, finding out what the machine's potential was, knowing what it could or
  couldn't do. . The IT Center was in D.
  Pedro V, where the facilities of the Academic Association are still located today, where the Association bar is located.
  The work space was two rooms the size of this one. There weren't many people who went to the IT Center at that time. The
  first Computer Systems course was about to come out at the university, which came out perhaps two years later. There
  were very few students at that time, and there was very little use of it. I mean, there were only three or four jobs.




  Opening hours were throughout the day. At that time, we were working two shifts: one that went from 8 am to 3 pm and
  the other from 3 pm to 10 pm. However, it was on all night, anyone who wanted to go there to work could go, there was a
  guard down here who opened and closed the door for anyone who wanted to go there to work. It is evident that he knew
  perfectly well who the people who could were and were duly accredited.




  The employees who worked the shifts were me and Quintas. We were both responsible for the IC. The other
  our colleague, who was admitted at the same time as us, only joined us from
Machine Translated by Google
  October/November 1982, which was the time when the first "Data General" computer arrived at those facilities, at
  Gulbenkian. We went there, but that was only in October. In 1982, the University was concentrated in D.Pedro V,
  because there were only pavilions there, and then there were also some rooms down here, for Abade Loureiro, but they
  were few. We left D.Pedro V in October 1982, we went back to Gulbenkian, which had good facilities. It had a large room with
  plenty of workstations for students. The computer was a huge thing, even though it was a "giant micro computer." I
  remember that there were adventures like that, for example, I was working the night shift, so at that time we started
  working until midnight and worked shifts from 8 in the morning until midnight. Then the third element started working with
  us, we worked three shifts. And at midnight it was closing time, but I remember many nights that I spent there, that I left
  there at 3:30, 4:00 in the morning, because precisely that year, and from that year onwards, the Computer Systems
  course had a large increase, there was an entry of many students. Also because, from then on, the conditions for accessing
  the computer were different, because there were many jobs, but the computer, poor thing, dispatched one at a time. So I
  remember adventures like 20 students working at the same time. There were 20 terminals but they were all connected to
  the same computer, which was a giant micro computer. And it was like that, the student needed to see, he did the
  work, totally different from what it is now, so he wrote the work, then he had to compile and link it, to see if the program
  had syntax errors and if it was working. run well. And so, this compilation and linking work had to be done one at a
  time. So I was inside coordinating and I said:




  - "Oh man, now you all stop to start moving like that. Otherwise, no one will walk."



  There was only one. Therefore, to carry out work, others had to stop. What a hassle it was! But they were good years,
  very good, very rewarding. I have great friends of mine, those I call today "my boys" and "my girls", who are already
  engineers from that time, and I have great friends with whom I spent this type of episode, in this type of collaboration.




  I don't know if the Gulbenkian machines bothered the neighbors. In fact, the air conditioning unit made noise,
  it wasn't even the server itself, it was the air conditioning unit that had to be constantly on, which made noise, and then,
  there was the restriction that from midnight onwards it could not be If there was more noise, the air conditioning unit had
  to be turned off. People were already part of this scheme in principle and no one complained against it. In the nights, in
  those famous
  early in the morning until 4 am, we opened the windows to air out the systems room and turned off the air conditioning.




  I remember an episode at night at Gulbekian, one night, it was maybe 2am when I left
  service and when I was leaving, two minutes after I left the IT Center, the lights went out in the whole city. The whole city
  was left in darkness. So I thought: "Hey man, now what am I going to do! I don't see anything, I don't see a foot in front of
  me. I don't know what to do." So, I took a little shelter in a corner, because it was raining, and suddenly the garbage
  truck appeared.
  The men who were collecting the rubbish knew which route I was taking and so they always came after me to guide
  me along the way to my house. And that's how I managed to get to
  home, otherwise I would have spent another two hours waiting for the light to come back on. That is what happened.



  Honestly, I don't particularly remember any of the curious episodes between teachers and students, although there were
  several. I'm sure there were several that happened, but I'm no longer able to report them.
Machine Translated by Google
  I remember so many episodes. I have a lot of things that they offered me, dinners and lunches,
  participation in processions of the Enterro da Gata, the Academic Week, they would pick me up from
  the house, they forced me to go with them, I had to go after them because they did me a party. They all
  liked me a lot and I liked them. We made great friends and we did funny things.
  I remember our dinners, games, things we all did together. At that time, the relationship with the students
  was great, excellent, something that is not the case today. I mean, in that
  Back then there were fewer of us, it was that restricted group, 20 or 30, now there are hundreds. In the
  past, there were 20 or 30 IT Systems courses and there wasn't, I mean, the proliferation of courses that
  there are today. There were Computer Systems, Mathematics and Computer Sciences, MCC, which
  were the ones that were around there, that always went there, the ones that we spent the most time with
  and that we knew. I knew all their names, now I don't know anyone's name. They knew me and I
  knew them all by name. We were like a family, the IT Center family.


 We spent 10 years at the Gulbenkian facilities. It was only after 10 years that we went to Gualtar, in 1992.
  In Gualtar there was a lot of evolution in terms of systems. From 87/88 onwards we started to have that
 first machine, the giant micro computer. A monumental crane had to come, which came from the
 Matosinhos shipyards on purpose, to place it, to put it through the window inside. It was put through
 the window and not through the door because it didn't fit. There was no way to get him up the stairs, no
 way to think about it. It was transported in a huge truck. It came from Lisbon, from the headquarters of
 "Data General", which is still today the company for the large systems that we have here, which
 nowadays are nothing, they are large systems that are a quarter of the size of the other one,
 which was a huge thing. I mean, then there was the computer, which was a huge thing, the size of a
 closet. It had two things: where there were two separate removable disks. I found it curious, one of the
 funny things, there were some kids there who lived in Gulbenkian, because that was a residential
 building, who went to see those things and said:


  - "Eh, what beautiful washing machines. What beautiful washing machines."


  They thought it was a laundry room. Those were good times, times when we did everything: we were
  cleaning women, we were night guards, I did everything. At the IT Center I did everything.


 The systems have evolved, so the care they required here a few years ago is now
 no longer require it. Let's say that the operator's role nowadays is practically... contentless.
 So it happens that we have little to do these days. We don't have to do much, because the system
 nowadays is already highly supported and doesn't need us for anything. Whereas here a few years ago,
 any problem that existed could only be resolved with our intervention. Nowadays he alone overcomes
 all the flaws that may exist.




  At this point, things have evolved a lot. It's Professor Proença, Engº Pina, Cecília, Ramada,
  Filipe, then there is the communications center that was here until now, now it is no longer there, the staff
  of computing, which is 20 people.


  The IT Center at Gulbenkian had three divisions. One that was a large room for students, and that was
  controlled by one person. This person controlled the entrances and exits of the students, and no one
  could enter. Then there was the secretariat part and the administrative part which was on the other
  side of the floor. The floor had three floors, right, left and back. So the back was the room
  of students, where the terminals were, which were connected to the main computer. Then there was the
Machine Translated by Google
  part of the administration and there was the operations part, which was our part, where there
  was the computer room and then there was the graphic material room, therefore, where images could
  be digitized, etc. Although it wasn't what it is now in the past, the systems were totally different.
  Nowadays there are scanners, at that time there were no scanners, there was the possibility of
  making some programs and then there was a machine that made drawings, which was called
  PLOTTER that drew what was programmed. This was on our part, it was controlled by us. The student
  access part had its own person to control this.


  Regarding my daily life at Gulbenkian, I was the one who practically always worked the night shift.
  Firstly because one of our colleagues was disabled from the Armed Forces, so there was no way he
  was alone at night, he didn't have a leg, he had prosthetics. Quintas, for family reasons, found it useful
  to work during the day. I found it more convenient to work at night because it allowed me to have the
  day free and, therefore, to be able to do the housework, as I'm a bit of a day job.
  Therefore, the wife left for school first thing in the morning, I stayed at home, took care of lunch, tidied up the
  rooms, took the kid to school. I mean, I organized my life differently and came to work
  At night, I always worked the night shift.


  I entered at 6:30 pm, and as I told you a while ago, I left at 3:30 am. Work hard. It was at a time when the
  computer demanded our presence there, on top of it. Even more so because of what I told you
  previously, where I said:


  - "Oh man, stop everyone, now this one gets going."


  So it was necessary to do a trick there to make the process of that step go faster and the others would
  have no "stand-by", then when that one was finished, it would be on "stand-by" and someone else
  would go. I went one at a time. I spent many nights there until 3am to make life easier for the students.


  There were cases where I had to ask students to stop work to process an assignment.
  There was, for example, the case of professors, university researchers, who had to do their doctoral
  work or something else and who, therefore, had to develop computer programs and which, at that time,
  were run in languages, which today Nowadays, they are practically not used: Fortran and Pascal, which
  were very heavy languages and therefore required large computer resources and, therefore, people.



 I remember people, for example, a gentleman, who today, I know, is a minister, has some sort of
 portfolio in Mozambique, who was Salomão, black, a tall, strong guy, with whom we got along very well.
 Quintas and I got along very well with him. We even had several dinners where we brought our families
 together: mine, Quintas's and Salomão's, either at Quintas' house or at my house. But, for example, this
 gentleman had to do major research work, there were times when he got there, started his programs
 and nobody else did anything. He would come in and no one else would do anything. So, and that was
 our mission, I was very concerned about making life easier for all students. So what was I doing? As
 this gentleman usually went there, put
 the programs running in Batch, that is, I would order the computer: "Do this and I'll come here
 tomorrow and see the result." When the students wanted to work, I stopped this man's work, let the
 students' work run and when the students' work was done, I let his work run. I mean, because some
 were there waiting to see the result while the other was going to see the result the next day, so there
 was time. His service continued throughout the night and from 8 am onwards,
 that was the time he started working, from that time on, between 8am and 12pm, most of the students
 had classes and weren't there, they didn't use the computer, they had free time to run their
Machine Translated by Google
  his works. There was no need to waste time at night, he started running early in the morning.




  These were times of great dedication, along the lines of trying to make life easier for all students. I knew all their names,
  their numbers. I knew them all. Nowadays I know some people in this university universe. Not at that time. It was a
  small group of 30 students, and from a certain point onwards things started to take a turn for the worse.




  I like what I do, I always have. Computer science was something that captivated and fascinated me. I remember that I was
  still studying in Porto, I hadn't joined the military yet, I was at the Industrial Institute, in Porto, and I was already taking an
  IT course. At that time, in 1971/72, computers had started to appear in Portugal, which were those bizarre things.
  Nobody knew how to work with
  computers. Computers were destroyed without knowing why. I remember the old Emissora Nacional, which is now RDP,
  was Porto's national broadcaster. The guys bought a computer, which was fashionable, and stuck the computer in a
  room right by the window, for everyone to see.
  to see. After a short time he stopped working and why? Those were all circuits and the sun ruined it all. And find out
  what it was? First they found out it was a day of judgment. After all, they discovered that was it. The shutters
  began to be drawn. At that time, I was fascinated by IT because it was something different.




  I remember one of the first definitions I was given of what a computer is: "a computer is a machine that makes
  errors at great speed." For example, all he has to do is say that 2x2=5 and, based on this principle, he does all the
  calculations wrong. It does it at great speed, but it does everything badly. And it was something that always fascinated me.
  I remember that when I first came to D.Pedro V, we had this little computer, the big one. I started making some programs.
  My father had the bookstore and I told him this:




  - "Let me make some programs for them to pay staff salaries, organize files for stock."




  So as a joke I started doing it, because I liked doing it, I put it to work and then experimented, and it really worked.
  Obviously it was never something that was adopted by my father, because they didn't have a computer, they did
  everything by hand. In the past, everything was done by hand.
  There were accounting machines, but they weren't computers at all, because there was no money for that, the material
  was very expensive at that time. But it was something I always liked.




  I don't think there's anything else I want to highlight. These 20 years at the university, at the Informatics Center,
  were very rewarding for me, not only because of what I was able to give and transmit to the people I worked with, but also
  because of everything I managed to learn at my own expense or through contact with many people. It was a very rewarding
  20 years that provided the fulfillment of my professional career, the one that was allowed. He could have been a doctor or
  engineer, but no, he was destined to be a computer operator, working at the IT Center.

  I think that in these 20 years, I don't know if I have been an exemplary worker, nor is it up to me to judge my work. Now I can
  tell you one thing, I put my commitment into everything I did,
  I dedicated myself to the cause with all my abilities. And if I couldn't do more, "poor thing", it's because I can't give more.
  And whoever gives what he has cannot give more.

 ## Electricity failure ##




  I remember an episode at night at Gulbekian, one night, it was maybe 2am when I left
  service and when I was leaving, two minutes after I left the IT Center, the lights went out in the whole city. The whole
  city was left in darkness. So I thought: "Hey man, now what am I going to do! I don't see anything, I don't see a foot in
  front of me. I don't know what to do." So, I took a little shelter in a corner, because it was raining, and suddenly
  the garbage truck appeared.
  The men who were collecting the rubbish knew which route I was taking and so they always came after me to guide
  me along the way to my house. And that's how I managed to get to
  home, otherwise I would have spent another two hours waiting for the light to come back on. That is what happened.



  ## "Very full day" ##




  Currently, my day is generally very full, I do a lot of things. I get up around 8:00/8:15 in the morning and do the normal
  things: shower, shave, take my wife to school. Have to
  be there at 9am and I generally never work in the morning, either the afternoon shift or the night shift. So, as I have the
  morning free, I'm the one who makes lunch for all of us, for me, the wife and the son. So, I make lunch, I tidy up the
  house, I make the beds, I tidy up whatever is needed. This in the morning. I deal with matters that I have to deal with
  and that's how I spend the morning. In the afternoon, when I have the afternoon free, after lunch, I take my wife to school
  again, then I usually go to my parents' house, because my relationship with my parents, and especially with my father,
  It is a relationship of deep friendship, which leads us to practically daily contact, there will be exceptions like today, for
  example. I didn't go there today, I couldn't. This is practically how I spend the afternoon until it's time to come here to
  work. Tomorrow I work the afternoon shift, for example, but in the evening I have a meeting with some friends at my
  father's house. So this is precisely why I work the afternoon shift on Thursdays because in the evening I have a meeting
  with friends.




  Obviously the most important activity for me at the moment is work, because that is what occupies me, to which I am
  deeply connected professionally, although I carry out other activities,
  but more in the field of collaboration, of providing voluntary service. I mean, my main activity is work.




  I'm a bit suspicious when it comes to talking about my qualities. I think I wouldn't say my best
  quality, I would say perhaps my best qualities. I have the capacity to work, the capacity to give, the capacity to sacrifice
  and the capacity to forgive, which is something that is very necessary nowadays.
  Here some time ago Pope John Paul II said that "There is no peace without justice, but there is also no justice without
  forgiveness." And forgiveness is extremely important, knowing how to forgive those who attack us, humiliate us, those
  who do us harm. We say: "Yes ma'am, you did us wrong, you will be punished for it, but I forgive you. " And don't hold
  that grudge against that person who did that to me. "Forgive our offenses just as we forgive those who have offended us."




  And to talk about my defects, the best person was my wife. I am convinced that we all have flaws, no one
  is perfect. We all have our little quirks. Often, things don't go well, as we expect, people react a little badly. There is a
  situation where
  I usually react badly, for example, I'm stopped at traffic lights, the traffic light is red and turns to green, and the guy in
  front of me doesn't start, so I say: "Come on man, don't be
Machine Translated by Google
  " This is a defect. I have a tendency to react like this. It's curious that I later say: "Hey man, sorry, I exaggerated a bit." We
  all have defects, the habit that there is always something... that our self-love often leads us to consider ourselves superior.
  Although this happens to me, I always try to combat this idea. I recognize that I have flaws.




  I find it easy to establish contacts with anyone. He can either be a street sweeper, or be the president of the Chamber, or be
  prime minister.



  I feel great about the life I have today. My life is what God wants. I am convinced of this. I mean, I have what I need, I
  might have a little more than what I need. For example, having two cars in my name, one is mine, the other is my son who
  drives it. The car I have is ours, it belongs to the family, mine and my wife's. I am a person who has never worried about
  owning a car, a house, this or that, but about having what is necessary for everyday life. The conviction, the faith that
  I have leads me to be well and not worry about having this, having that, I think precisely the opposite, knowing that I have
  this and that and there are many people who don't. And there are things

  that I have and could stop having, giving in to someone else who doesn't have it. For example, having two or three
  heaters and knowing that there is a guy who doesn't have any. Or having two or three blankets for my bed and knowing
  that the partner next to me doesn't have any or only has one. I can give the shirt and coat. If someone passes by me and
  I'm cold, I give them my coat so they don't get cold.
  I try to be like this in life and I feel good. I feel that I have our daily bread and that it is the main
  and, therefore, I have no ambitions to have a house on the beach or in the countryside, nor a house with a pool, nor
  three cars, nor anything.



  If I went back in time, I don't know if I would change anything, I don't know, but I don't think about it either.
  The present moment arrives. I don't worry about the fact that it could have been like this or like that, it is what it is. And I
  feel good about who I am and what I have.



  ## "Volunteer for the Work of Mary" ##




  I provide voluntary service to the Work of Mary, popular movements, and collaborate with several institutions linked to
  the church, in the parish of S. Lázaro, linked to that of S.Victor.



  The Work of Mary has a great story to tell, because the main objective of the Work of Mary is the construction of unity
  among all peoples, all men. So it's all a continuous change
  attitudes, the way of being towards life, in relationships with people, in donation and delivery, provision of support
  services to the community, which leads us to a predisposition towards certain activities.




  The Work of Mary is more of an association, a group of people who meet, let's say, in small groups, weekly, fortnightly. In
  larger groups we have meetings throughout the year in various places. For example, now we are going to inaugurate what
  we call "our citadel", which is a city where we can live for a while, therefore, as long as each of us wants, to precisely build
  a new world. I mean, the world where we are all equal, we all live for the same community, where the law of love is the main
  law. Therefore, Jesus' new commandment that says "Love one another as I have loved you", and there in this citadel we will
  have the opportunity to put it into practice for as long as we want.
Machine Translated by Google

  The citadel is a physical space, which already exists, which is in an area close to Alenquer, which
  began to be built around five years ago and already has some structures where we will now create
  social centers for meetings, with houses for people who are most connected to the Work. Then there
  will be, which is currently still in the planning stages, a business hub with several companies that will
  operate according to a new type of economy, which is the economy of communion which is based on the cult
  of the company will not be the profit, but precisely the creation of a new mentality, that is, in which
  the profits will be to help those who need it most, and then to help the construction of new men,
  with a new mentality, who will allow the development of these companies.


  We here in the Braga community work, in principle, in small groups. My group, which includes me, my father and four other
  people, there are six of us, we meet weekly to delve deeper into the spirituality of the work, where we share all
  the experiences we have on a daily basis, which we acquire. And we have several things in common. Every month we usually
  gather what we have that is superfluous, what we can make available, and we make it available to the community, not only for
  the construction of this citadel, but also to help various members of the Work who are in difficulty due to lack of
  employment. , etc. We also help various activities of the Work, which are developing, such as construction projects. We have
  development projects in several African countries: in Cameroon, Angola, Kenya, Burundi, Argentina, Brazil. There are several
  Work projects that are being developed for the construction of citadels, to support people who have joined the Work and
  who are experiencing difficulties, lack of work, etc.




  There are people of all ages on site, from 4 to 90 years old. I'm remembering, for example, the kids'
  meetings. I have 4/5 year old nephews that I take to meetings and they come away enchanted by the
  games they play, the friends they meet, the songs they learn to sing. But above all, what impressed
  me most, when I discovered the Work of Mary, about 35 years ago, was precisely the discovery that
  we have a father, God the Father, who loves us deeply and who is always by our side. We generally
  have the idea of a God who is what is up there, but no, it is the discovery that he is by our side, between
  me and the partner, who can be with me at any moment. We can create a relationship that we call
  Jesus in the middle, that is, when we are willing to give our lives for each other. Being willing to lose
  everything that is mine, for the other, to listen to the other, understand their problems, share their
  joys and pains with them. This is creating a new relationship between men and, therefore, it is a new
  mentality that is emerging on the face of the earth.



  Today the Work of Mary is spread in around 130 countries with around 4 and a half million
  adherents. In fact, it is a very interesting thing. On March 24th, Palm Sunday, we will do
  The inauguration of the citadel, which is down there, is still a bit of a journey away. They are close to
  300 kilometers. But, in fact, it is a work that opens up horizons for us, because nowadays we are
  generally, by temperament, very closed, very reserved. People are afraid of contact with their fellow
  man, with their neighbor, who is by their side. It's because ? Because I'm in that position of saying:
  "That person is coming to upset me or to ask me for something." This spirituality instills in us the
  readiness to love, to listen to others, to serve them in whatever is necessary. Precisely for this reason,
  here at the university everyone gets along with me, everyone likes Moreira, because Moreira is an
  individual who makes him big or small, whether he's beautiful or ugly, nice or the unfriendly, they
  are all the same. Therefore, this counts a lot and it is this way of acting, of being in society, that
  gives us the possibility of these things coming to light later.


  The idea of joining the Work of Mary, it was curious, came about practically by chance. Since I was
  very young, I always accompanied my father everywhere, wherever my father went, I went with him. It turns ou
Machine Translated by Google
  My father, at one point, took a Christianity course. I had said that when I was a kid he didn't care
  nothing to the church, I didn't want to know anything. But at a certain point my father took a Christianity
  course and changed completely, from then on he started to collaborate in everything related to the
  church. One day he was invited to give a lecture on a topic, in Ponte de Lima, more than 35 years ago, it
  was in 1966, and I went with my father. My father developed the
  theme he had to develop and in the meantime they had already asked him to be brief, not to go on too long,
  because there were some people there who wanted to talk. The people who wanted to speak were
  precisely the people from Obra de Maria, who had just entered Portugal through the Northern border and it
  would practically be the second lecture they had given here in Portugal. They had been in Viana and then
  were there in Ponte de Lima. It was from there that we came into contact with the Work of Mary and began
  to develop the Work here in Portugal.


  To tell you what my biggest concerns are, I will use a phrase from the founder and president of the
  popular movements of the Work of Mary. She was also once asked what her biggest worries were and she
  said: "I don't have worries because I'm always busy."
  Because this is all a way of being in life. What is my concern? Is it in relation to the future? What could happen?
  One of the main points of spirituality, and what the spirituality of the Work of Mary teaches us, is precisely
  to live well in the present moment. Because the past is over. The only thing I can do is "My God, if I did well,
  I did well; if I didn't, I'll try
  be better!". What will come tomorrow, will come tomorrow, but the future, tomorrow, I will have to build
  right now. It's just that I am moment by moment building the future. Therefore, the present moment is a very
  important thing, let's say I have no worries. I try to be busy in the present moment, what we say, to do God's
  will well in the present moment.


  I can tell you some things that happened to me. For example, a few years ago, I remember I was at home and I
  had some light bulbs that were burnt out, and so I said: "Well, I'm going to go to a store and I'm going to buy
  the light bulbs, bring them home and fix this. ." There was a faulty switch there and I had to buy some
  things to replace some parts. So I left the house and went to the store to buy this material that I needed. So I
  arrived at the store and after a while an old lady came in, very distressed, because she had lost power at
  home:


  - "Oh, I was coming here because I lost power at home, I don't have light in my room, I have to go to bed in
  the dark. The radio doesn't play. I needed one of the electricians to come to my house and see what was going
  on. "


  The man in the store said:


  - "Oh my lady, but we don't have a chance now. Today we don't have a chance to go and see what's going
  on."


  At that time he said:


  - "Well, I don't know much about electricity, but I'll try to solve the problem for you."


  And I spoke to the lady:
Machine Translated by Google
 - "Look, I don't know much about electricity, but I can go to your house and see what's going on because there must
 be a problem with the fuses or something like that."



  - "Ah yes! It was a great favor that you did me."



  - "Let's go then."



  I went to the lady's house and managed to solve the problem, the lady was... Hi Jesus! It was a joy. And it was the simplest
  thing in the world to solve that. The problem is that if she went there, an electrician would solve the problem and she
  would pay a lot of money. I went there and resolved the problem for the lady. But when I solved the problem for you, I was
  unable to solve mine. I'm like, "What now? I won't be able to solve the problem anymore!" It was a Saturday and the store
  was closed in the afternoon, and I no longer had a chance to solve my problem. When I got home the problem was solved.
  A family member had been there who had solved my problem. Therefore, this only proves what God says in the Gospel
  “Give and you will receive”.




  A few days ago my father-in-law passed away, and I needed to take care of the paperwork for the widow's survivor's pension.
  So, I drove the car from one side to the other, here and there, doing the paperwork for the lady. There was a day when
  she turned to me and said:



  - "Oh Zé, thank you and God pay you."


  And I said to him like this:



  - "Well, you can be sure you'll pay."



  A week later I received a check refunding some discounts on money that I had deducted too much, years
  ago. I say: "Do you see, do you pay or not pay?!"
  Therefore, I have this predisposition to be at the service of others selflessly. Giving with the left hand without the right
  knowing, because there are a lot of people who give a lot, but want it to appear on the front page of the
  newspaper, "It was so-and-so who gave and did and what happened." Giving to appear on the pages of newspapers is
  not of great value.

  ## Socializing with people ##




  In my leisure time I do many things: I spend time with people, with friends, I read, I have fun because I also need
  to, and I accompany, for example, my wife.



  On the weekends I usually spend time with my family, with friends, in my big family that is Obra de Maria. We usually
  meet once a month. Our little group meets once a week on Thursday, but generally we always have meetings and
  visit each other.
  We spend a lot of time with each other, exchanging experiences and readings.



  ## "Peace in the world, see everyone at peace." ##
Machine Translated by Google




  My greatest wish is to see everyone at peace. Perhaps my greatest desire would be to see peace in the world, just
  that for this you need to give a lot. We cannot demonstrate to ask for peace, we have to build it because that is the big
  problem. Peace has to be built by each one of us. And the great difficulty for universal peace is precisely that man has not
  yet realized that the first worker of peace is himself and not the institutions, let's say, the governments that decree
  peace. If
  If I don't make peace in my house with my family, with my children, with my wife, there's no point in me walking around with
  flags asking for peace from the government. If I don't create peace, I don't stop raising little problems, sometimes petty
  things, pulling the coals on my sardine, instead of letting the coals be, saying like this: - "Okay, that's enough for my
  sardine, but also It's yours. And now let's fix things.
  We turn around the sardines and both remain." Now if I want it just for myself and "now yours eat it raw"
          , I don't build anything. I build more and more division between men, because more and more
  I only deal with my interests and I don't worry about the interests of others. That's the big problem.




  I have no personal dreams, I am willing to help as much as possible in building peace and
  harmony between men, that, yes, I could say is my big dream: the construction of peace and
  harmony.



  ## "I had no disappointments" ##




  In life I hope I can always continue to act the way I am acting, because I think it is the most correct way. I think I
  have the discernment to be able to continue like this and I also hope to be understood by everyone around me. Besides,
  I don't have any great ambitions to own houses or yachts. No no. I usually say, and people who know me know, I
  am capable of giving away the clothes I have on my body if necessary. If I have to give my clothes, I will. Now, it is
  clear that not just anyone comes here to tell a story, but I am an individual who gives everything. Being ready to give,
  the simple fact of being willing, without any interest, to solve the problem of either the other elderly lady, or help the family
  member, or other cases of the kind, leads to you later receiving the reward and receiving a hundred times more than
  you expected. I am certain that there is no point in keeping everything to myself, I maintain an open attitude, of being ready
  to share everything I have. In fact, something that goes back to my childhood days, in my mother's country, where the
  houses were all open, no one locked the door. It is a lifestyle in which there may not be fortune, well-being, but there is
  happiness, which is the most important thing.




  Throughout my life I have not had any disappointments. I have had several setbacks in my life but they have
  never disappointed me. I tried to enter university: I took the entrance exams, unless I'm mistaken, for at least two years
  and failed both years. There were setbacks, but not disappointments. You never know what would have happened if you
  had gone the other way. Let's assume that I could have been, at that time, if I had entered university, if I had completed
  higher education, a good lawyer, a good doctor. And besides, what would it be like? He would have the spirit and
  the way of acting, the way
  to be in front of the society I have? There you go, the present moment counts a lot. Being well with myself and with the
  world, with those around me, in the present moment, knowing who I am, what
  I can do it, knowing the limitations I have, but I'm fine.



  We are very exhibitionist today, we really like to stand out, we like to be the biggest, if
Machine Translated by Google
  I want to have a bigger one. When it shouldn't be like this. One of the best things that life has, that life offers to whoever
  wants it, is precisely the possibility of giving something with my right hand and not waiting to receive something else in my
  left hand. We must give for giving and not always wait to have everything, to have that "culture of having". In the movement I'm
  part of we talk a lot about this: the "culture of giving" is taught, which is opposed to the "culture of having". So give support,
  help, a simple smile, affection, attention. For example, I remember a while ago my mother hired a new maid for her house. Then
  the maid went to tell my mother:




  - "Oh ma'am, your eldest son is very nice. Look, no one treated me the way he treated me."




  I mean, there it is, it's that obsession I have: I'm superior to my partner, but that superiority shouldn't be manifested
  because, in fact, I'm not. To the extent that I am able to help, to try to solve the problem of someone who is smaller than me.
  So, this person is
  say like this:



  - "Hey man, that guy has more than me, but he's a cool guy. We can count on him."



  Otherwise, they say:



  - "That one is mistreating."



  And this has always been the type, the way I have always, since I was little, viewed social relationships.
  The great evil of humanity today is precisely this: it is relationships. The problem at the level
  global society in society is not so much the problem of the rich and the poor, but it is the problem of the rich who want to be
  richer and richer and who don't know how to relate to each other. Now with these immigration problems I think a lot
  about the Ukrainians and Africans who come in here and are taking away our jobs, and the French, across Europe. And
  I ask myself: "Which would be better? Would we be spending money to prevent them from getting in here? Or would it be
  better if we gave their countries conditions for development?"




  In the case of oil exploration in Africa, the Americans, the English go there to get the oil and bring it here at the price of rain,
  then they refine it, take the essential products, gasoline and I don't know what, then sell it much more expensive. . Why don't
  they help each other, don't do the opposite. For example, the problem of external debt in poor countries. They say that
  the external debt of poor countries should be eliminated, but it should not be eliminated, some say that it should not be
  done because otherwise they would spend the money for nothing and remain without development anyway. There it is,
  they should reach a consensus, say: "I forgive you your debt, but you have to take that money that you were going
  to pay me and you have to invest it to build hospitals, factories, etc., to develop. Because if you don't do that, you'll start
  paying me again. I forgive you but you have to do this and in a year you have to show me what you did, I'll still forgive you,
  otherwise I won't. I forgive you." There should be another type of relationship between the various countries, between the
  various communities. Society should develop in another way. That's what's important. @corpus\LucioCraveiro.md #
  Interview with Lúcio Craveiro da Silva




  ## Born in Tortosendo ##

  My name is Lúcio Craveiro da Silva. I was born in Tortosendo, Covilhã, on November 27, 1914.




  My father was called Gabriel Raimundo da Silva, my mother was Maria de Lurdes Craveiro da Silva. My maternal grandfather
  was called José Craveiro. I don't know about my paternal grandfather.



  My father was a farmer on the border, in S.Pedro do Rio Seco, and later pursued his professional life as a postal worker.
  My mother was from Tortosendo. My grandfather was a merchant and the family later
  developed. Regarding my uncles: one is a doctor, another is in industry and my aunts got married and moved on with their
  lives. It was a very well-known Tortosendo family.



  On one occasion we had a family reunion, where more than a hundred people gathered, all from the Craveiro family, this
  was in 1998. We are all spread out across Portugal because the interior has few possibilities for life. Beira Interior is
  poor, and therefore, anyone who wants to do anything in life
  ends up leaving. That's why we are spread across Portugal, and even here in Braga, at the University of Minho, I have
  cousins who came here, to teach.



  My father's family was dedicated to agriculture. They went to Brazil and Argentina and I never heard from them again. The
  ones on my mother's side are from Tortosendo and are still there.



  The memories I have are of my maternal grandfather, and they are wonderful! My grandfather was a very good friend of
  mine. One day he slapped me and then he almost asked for forgiveness and I said: - "No! Grandpa was right to slap me!"




  My grandfather was an enterprising man, there was a lot of sympathy around him. He was a man who knew how to get
  along, he had no enemies, they were all very good friends with him and that's why almost everyone who came to Covilhã,
  from that region, stopped at his store to chat for a while and then went on to Covilhã. It's an interesting thing. His father had
  connections between Coimbra and Covilhã, which was the connection they made in "galeras", commercial cars, between
  Coimbra and Covilhã. I believe that my great-grandfather, who I knew from my father, who came to Tortosendo to escape
  military life...
  Tortosendo had the privilege of the red boards, which belong to Guimarães, and the lands that had the red boards were
  exempt from military service. And then he came there from Lisbon and settled there so as not to go into military life. This
  was already at the beginning of the 19th century. Old, but I still walked with it, it must have been around 3 or 4 years old.
  That's what I know from my family.



  All my education comes from my mother's family, because my father's family, as I say, was far away, and they went to
  Brazil and I've never seen them since. Whereas I met my mother's entire family. It was in the Craveiro family, deep down,
  that I was born and developed as a child.



  I have two brothers: one is like me, he also became a priest, he joined later than me, but he is older and worked in Braga,
  at the Faculty of Philosophy and then moved to Coimbra and died there.
  My sister is still alive, she is married, she was a primary school teacher. It's renovated now. She's younger than me and is a
  domestic worker, since her professional life is over.

  My greatest memories are of family gatherings: my uncles played the pianola, but they also knew how to play the
  violin and other instruments, and they sang too. I remember those evenings very well. From time to time the family would
  also go out for a whole day and spend the night outside in those surrounding areas. I have memories of that time.
  They must have arranged these meetings for me, because this coexistence for the children, where everyone understands
  each other, sings, tells stories, is very good.



  I still remember my uncle wanting to teach me how to dance, but he wasn't able to. I was 7 years old. Those games
  marked me forever. I liked family because families, at that time, were very united because they were not dispersed like
  they are today. Not even the mothers were at work, so they were at home, and this gave the family a coexistence,
  in this case, very rich, with interest in each other, when someone was doing well everyone was happy about it, when
  someone suffered, because everyone suffered . Today it is difficult to have this coexistence in a family. It was a big family,
  there were six or seven of my uncles.




  I got along well with my parents, but my mother understood me better. My mother knew how to listen, understand, she
  accompanied me a lot in my successes and failures and helped me a lot in that aspect. I physically don't remember my
  mother very well, it was more the way she was, that's what stayed with me about my mother. Then I was rector, I had all these
  positions, and who marked me for all
  life was my mother, especially in terms of knowing how to accept people, being friends with people.
  There are several cases in my life that have happened and that I have always tried to resolve in a humane way, which
  is not always possible because there are bitter people who are difficult to deal with. In fact, I have always tried to
  respect the people I dealt with and always put myself on their side, because if we want to impose our vision, our point of
  view, we have to try to understand other people's perspectives and see at that point what is the best solution.




  My father was a fighter, he defended his ideas with iron and fire. Imagine that one of the things that still impresses me today
  is the following: you could only move up a category at the post office if you said you knew how to speak French. All my
  colleagues signed up saying they knew French because they knew how to say "merci
  beaucoup." My father said, "No, that's not knowing French. I don't know." He was the only one who didn't go up. He was
  an upright man. This set an example for me for the rest of my life: try to be straight and serious.



  Living with my brother... it's curious that we were two/three years apart, but we didn't spend much time together
  because when I was in primary school, my brother was already at the Industrial School. In Covilhã, at that time, there
  was no high school yet. A city that did not have a high school, had a very good Industrial School, very good training,
  which allowed you to immediately enter the Instituto Superior Técnico de Lisboa. My father doubted going to Covilhã,
  and wanted to go to Guarda, which had a high school and was the district capital. But, in fact, the Industrial School was
  very good.



  In the scouts, I was a wolf and he was already a wolf. But we always got along very well, even though the two of
  us didn't spend much time together. We spent much more time together in Braga, when we were at the Faculty of
  Philosophy together. It was the only time in our lives that we were together. We were very good friends when
  we met. He died about 10 years ago.



  Currently, my family is my sister. We always get together at Easter, in the summer, but we spend more time together over the
  phone than directly. Only when she comes here or I go there. We have a very big age difference, seven/eight years apart. I
  also didn't spend much time with her because I wasn't home at the time, we met on vacation, that's when there was
  more

  conviviality.



  The family left an impression on me and I have no doubt about that, both in the religious aspect and in my Catholic life, although
  My uncles were all Jesuits, but my parents didn't practice. Despite everything, they were tolerant of each other. There were
  Republicans of both parties in the family, there were monarchists, but they always got along very well in the family. You also
  know a lot about what marked me. My friends still today, I get along with everyone because we can have some arguments,
  but never those arguments,
  just exchange ideas. Evidently, they know what I think, they respect me naturally. This also impacted me because, from a
  political and even religious point of view, there was everything.




  It was a normal house because there was part that belonged to the Post Office and then it was a house where everyone had
  their own room and a backyard, which was where I played. It was right in the center of the town, which was in Bairro da
  Amoreira, it had a large mulberry tree, which doesn't exist today. And the house, the last time I saw it, was already falling
  down, full of holes.



  My brother was born in Tortosendo with me, my sister was born later when we moved to Linhais
  da Serra, I was about 4 years old or something like that, when we moved to Linhais da Serra and then from there we
  came to Covilhã.




  My mother worked at home, was a maid and we studied, went to classes. I started going to classes when I was 6 years old. And
  I remember very well, in Covilhã, I went to school alone. Now they always go by car to pick up the children because it
  is dangerous because of the cars. At that time there was no danger. I was going to walk up there. Classes started at 10am and
  I left home at 9:30am.
  Arrive on time. I wasn't going there alone, it was something that scared me, there were dangers on the street. Today in the city,
  a 6-year-old child crossing the street is always dangerous.



  I still remember the first car that arrived in my land, that idea stuck with me, it would be the first, because in fact they were ox
  carts, horse carts, that's what there were, that weren't really dangerous for a child.




  My father went to work, I even remember very well that we had to have dinner early because he had to go to work, often late at
  night. And we always had to adapt our eating and dinner times precisely because of my father.




  At home, the one who had the most authority was the father, or he thought he did because mothers are very good at
  have authority. Now when she said:"Look what I'll tell your father.", "Oh no. If you want to hit me, hit me
  the mother."




  My father was a man of great ardor who made his life his own. He came from a small village and life was fast paced, so he
  was a dictator, and sometimes a little violent in certain things. My mother was very balanced and I learned a lot from my
  mother. Men handle themselves better with delicacy and
Machine Translated by Google
  attention rather than pushing. And my mother knew how to use that and we learn from these things.
  Learn for life.




  I usually got up around 8am, my father was a little earlier, ate and set me on my way to class at 10am. Then I came home
  for lunch and at 2pm we had the second class until 4pm. At 4pm I would come home to play with my friends. My father
  didn't really like me coming
  home.



  Then there was a time when I belonged to the scouts. The Scouts was an animation that really impacted me. The scouts
  were a union where we went to camps, had their own laws regarding oaths, relationships with colleagues and
  fulfillment of duty. It was an interesting thing and it really held us back. We crossed the city for graduation. We really liked
  that at the time. But the issue of scouts really impacted me. I was nothing more than a werewolf because I left my homeland
  when I was 12 years old, and until then they were 'lobitos', then they were 'wolves' and then 'old wolves', it was the category
  of scouts. My brother was an 'old wolf' and even founded a scout group in Tortosendo.




  I had a slightly sick childhood, because of my gallbladder, I had an operation. That's what helped me.
  After this operation, the doctor said I wouldn't live to be 60 years old and I'm 88 years old. It was an operation I had, which
  removed a gallstone that could lead to cancer because it was already in
  wound. Fortunately it didn't come to that. And so, I spent a lot of time at home, then I came here to Braga in 1934. And I
  couldn't go out much and fortunately I became enthusiastic about the books, Antero de Quental and other authors that I
  really liked, and still like today, and in fact that part that marked me. Then, when I got rid of the disease, it was something
  else.




  At primary school there was a teacher who gave us the first letters and then we passed it on to the teacher to study for the
  exam. We all liked to pass it on to the teacher, who was wonderful. There was still the paddle. I got beaten up
  once, but it was actually quite fair and we didn't take it badly. Today that would be impossible and inconceivable. But in fact
  we prepared very well.
  I must tell you that the best grade of my life was in primary school, I got a 20. I never managed to get a 20 again in my
  life. I never failed because I always tried to prepare for the exams.
  And then, as I really liked, at first, Literature and Philosophy, these are subjects that excited me.




  The school was called 'Lar da Cabrada'. At the time I thought it was very big, then I went back there and it was very small
  and now it no longer exists, they even built houses there.



  The strongest memory I have of primary school is the teacher. What I liked most about him was the way he could explain
  clearly, with enthusiasm. I still remember the first text I
  I've been reading. It was about Spring and my father greatly admired it. I liked it because it got me excited about seeing
  what was written there. And so I was connecting word by word, then I read the second one, then I read the second one and
  the first one, then I read it. And the first text I read took 2 hours, according to my father. Because he managed to get us
  excited about this work of finding out what was written, what it represents, the accounts. So, I didn't have any
  difficulties in secondary school. I followed.

  Just now I said, in an interview here a few days ago, that one of the advantages I had in my training was having a good
  primary education teacher. Because when things start well it's easy to keep going,
  But when they start badly, it's difficult to straighten it out later. When the foundations of a house are good, the house holds
  up, when they are bad, it is difficult to build a house. And in this I really owe a lot to my primary school teacher. I was
  lucky.



  I fulfilled my obligations in class and the rest I wanted to do was play. And when something serious came up, I said:
  "That's up to my brother!" Because the aunts were a little annoying! The aunts were always after the boys and I wanted to
  play with my cousins. For me, the only serious thing was studying and the rest was fun. That was what marked me and I
  still think about it today.



  The education I received, culturally, I didn't learn it there, it's clear. It was my courses, then I studied, I had the
  opportunity to study a lot because to be a Philosophy professor I had to study Economics in Bilbao, it was during the war, I
  couldn't leave Spain, and then in Levanda. I studied Political Science and Philosophy here at the Faculty of Philosophy.
  Therefore, the culture was not there. But the appearance
  human coexistence there. The character, the way of being, yes, I feel like Craveiro, marked by my family.




  Throughout my studies I never had any difficulties because I studied easily and with pleasure, but I had
  There is always a principle that I summarize today as "those who don't know how to rest, don't know how to work". And in fact, I
  I attribute it to these causes because I then liked to play and have fun. And so I never had those tiredness, those
  exhaustions, nor the disenchantment with studying. I always liked to know and that was mine
  primary education teacher who got me involved.



  After primary school I completed secondary education in Spain in Castelo Rodrigo, the nearest town was "Cáseres". I
  stayed there for 5 years, because the Jesuits could not enter Portugal at that time.
  Then I went to Oia here in Galicia, where I joined the Society of Jesus. I was only there for seven or eight months because
  then we came to Portugal, to Braga where I continued my studies in Science and Philosophy.




  I studied Philosophy in Braga. Then they invited me to be a professor of Economic Ethics and Political Ethics at the
  Faculty of Philosophy and therefore, I went to study Economics at Deuston, in Bilbao. The name is Basque, but the region
  is actually in Bilbao. After that, I went to study Political Science in Leuven, the war had already ended. And I got my PhD in
  Philosophy, in Braga. I was Braga's first doctorate. I did my PhD in Braga and before there was no university, there was only
  the Faculty of Philosophy. I was a Literature teacher in Guimarães, it was there that I started my life as a teacher, so
  it was a city that left an impression on me. I was there as a teacher for three years.




  He went to Leuven, Belgium, in 1945/50. The trip was by train. We left here late in the afternoon, crossed Spain
  at night, and got up early at the French border. We were waiting for the train for a few hours. It got dark in France and we
  arrived in Paris early in the morning. We had to take our bags, because on the subway we had to change to another
  station. At 9 o'clock in the morning we went to Leuven. It was an adventure, but when you're young, you go with it.
  Today would be more
Machine Translated by Google
  This trip was painful, we were going by plane which is simpler.



  I did very well in Leuven because I was Portuguese. They can't deal with the Castilians and since I couldn't either, I got
  along very well. I remember a case that happened that was amazing. There was a time when Portgal beat Spain 4-1 in football,
  but it was a Basque who scored the goal. And in class they welcome me with a round of applause. I was amazed! -
  "Yes sir, you beat the Spanish, but we did well because we were the ones who scored the goal. The Basques didn't do
  badly, the Castilians did badly." See how things are. In fact, I did very well in that regard. There were also students there who
  were not Basque, nor Castilian, but Catalan, from Barcelona. We got along very well.




  I was in Leuven for two years, just as I was in Bilbao. I met many Portuguese emigrants who were there. Do you know that
  Portuguese people abroad are more friendly than here in Portugal?! It's extraordinary. We all got together as a
  Portuguese colony from time to time. In Leuven, the Portuguese were a group. We weren't against the others, if they
  came we would also get involved with them, but knowing that we could always count on the Portuguese.




  Something very annoying happened to me in Belgium. There was a group of Portuguese people there, when getting off a
  bus there was a very fat lady, who took a long time. A colleague was waiting for me and I said to him:-"Wait for this trouble to
  pass." And at the end the lady says:-"Thank you very much, I'm Portuguese." Poor thing. We were devastated! -"Oh
  ma'am, I'm sorry! It's a way of speaking, we didn't even think
  not even offend. It was a way of speaking because we thought no one understood us." But we were fine with this one. The
  lady even understood our position, which was not meant to offend. But that one came back to us.




  I really liked Leuven because it has an advantage that Portugal doesn't have, Belgium is well situated, it's between
  Germany, England and France and it has everything new. It's just that we are at the tail end of Europe and things arrive
  late. When I arrived here, it seemed to me that I couldn't find a job because we were ten years behind what was there, not
  because of incapacity, the Portuguese like to learn and learn things well, but precisely because in Belgium what was

  from England, Germany or France was there. Today there is more communication, and universities are more developed, they
  are connected with Germany, England and the United States. We are no longer isolated and that is a great thing and our
  culture has evolved a lot due to this aspect.




  I really liked Belgium. I came into contact with German, French and English culture. I really liked the open-mindedness and
  coming into contact with European culture, because I was closed-minded in Spain. And Belgian teachers were in contact with
  German culture. It was a big advantage for us, because after classes this came to light.




  We don't like Belgians at all, you know that Belgian women would rather marry a foreigner than a Belgian. The Belgians were
  violent towards women and everything. They were bitter people,
  Basically, French people passed by, Germans passed by, and there was a certain bitterness. And they are always at the bottom
  because they are a small nation. So in their lives, we didn't get along very well with the Belgians, but the university part was
  very good. The university was in contact with the currents of the world, and it was a great university in that respect, and that
  to open horizons is very good.
Machine Translated by Google
  Belgians really like to command, but despite that there were very good teachers. We saw things that
   Only now are they putting it in Portugal, we could choose the chairs we wanted. There were the first fundamental ones
  and then we chose the others that suited us. This plan was determined with teachers, then it went to the council,
  they approved the plan and then it followed. Which is a big plus. We are now coming to this because of Bologna. And this is
  what the University of Leuven is responsible for. And there was a very good group of teachers. For example, in Philosophy it
  is
  very good.



  ## Braga ##




  I came to Braga when I was 18/19 years old to study Philosophy. I remember the train trip I took from Spain to Braga because
  it was the first time I saw the sea. It was night, we were coming from Porto to Caminha and I went and tried to catch
  the sea water, touch the sea for the first time. It's curious, I was already 18 years old. Something that is now inconceivable
  because today's youth are more mobile than they were back then.




  Braga was very small. The Public Library, which is one of the oldest and most beautiful monuments in Braga
  they were the Gardens of the Episcopal Palace. At the bottom there was a chapel, which they later removed, and at the top
  there was a high wall, which Santos Silva once tore down. And I already told you:-"You created the best monument in Braga
  that you can't see." Rua Eça de Queirós did not exist, it was taken from the Gardens of this Episcopal Palace, which later
  became the Public Library and then the University of Minho.




  I remember the Cathedral before the Restoration, which was painted white inside, all Baroque, unfortunately they
  removed that whole part. Today the Cathedral is completely different inside. Religious ceremonies were very solemn. We
  would spend every Thursday, the holidays, at that time the holidays were on Thursdays, only with Carneiro Pacheco did the
  holiday of the week move from Thursday to Saturday. But the holiday on Thursdays dates back to the 16th century, and we
  went to Bom-Jesus on Thursdays. And I took advantage of the afternoon to come here to the Public Library, which was
  initially in the Congregados building and then moved to Largo do Paço. By the way, the library director, Dr.

  Alberto Feio was very surprised and then said: -"An 18/19 year old boy wants to visit the library? What interest does he
  have in the library?" - "Look, I have it because I like reading the Portuguese writers that we had. And I would like
  to meet other authors." I started studying Antero de Quental. And then I would come to the library to find out.




  So my life was in Braga. I've been from Braga since 1934.



  The city's cultural practice began to develop with the Faculty of Philosophy and we had national congresses there. It's
  even curious that the congress was promoted by the Faculty of Philosophy, but it was held at the Public Library, which was
  the only place where we had the opportunity to bring people together.




  ## full professor; Dean ##




  In November 1952/53 I completed my doctorate and in July of the following year I was appointed director of
Machine Translated by Google
  Faculty of Philosophy. I was director of the Faculty of Philosophy three times. The Faculty of Philosophy library was very
  well and in very good condition. It was one of the best Philosophy libraries in Portugal. Today it is very up to date
  because we took advantage during the war, when the escudo was worth a lot (1 escudo was worth 4 pesetas), to buy very
  cheap books. It has a group of very good teachers.
  A few days ago, the professor of Philosophy of Science, who was the best professor of Philosophy and Science in
  Portugal, Passo Sousa Alves, died here. The other teachers have all died, in fact, but it was a group of very good teachers
  and they imposed themselves on Portugal. The first Philosophy congress in Portugal was held at the Faculty of
  Philosophy in 1955 and all the universities came here and as we were afraid that some wouldn't come, we invited
  some foreigners. But luckily they all came. We were 400 congressmen.




  In terms of facilities, when I joined, they were very poor. That faculty they have, I was the one
  I built it, ran for PRODEP and won. I was already a professor at the University of Minho, but after I retired, I worked there
  and here and as the director there died and, at the time, they asked me to stay for two years, I had to stay for eight years,
  because I was involved in PRODEP until I wanted it to end and I was there.




  I, who never liked governing, had bad luck. When I left the position of rector it was a liberation. I like investigating,
  I really enjoy it. The poor dean is solving problems that appear, God knows not when or how. Now the university is
  more developed, but back then it was even worse. I went to Lisbon almost every week to solve the problems.
  This helped me a lot because I got to know the Ministry of Education from the inside, because knocking

  wrong door is wasting time, we have to try to knock on the door that interests us. And I met the Ministry of Education and
  that helped me a lot because I knew who was in charge and who solved the problems and who prevented them. But I had to
  go to Lisbon, and those trips along the old road, eating in these restaurants on the miserable roads, usually with some
  olive oil that had already been served the other day. I
  I had trouble eating these foods and always going back and forth to solve any problem. It was very painful in that
  aspect.



  Not at university. Here we had a good team, we were friends and we worked. The University of Minho has had a good team
  from the beginning. For the first time, a dean who is not from the team is running. This rector was also part of the installation
  committee, as was Machado dos Santos. Now, for the first time, a person who is no longer from the initial team will
  become rector. Which is also good. It's good that it's developing, but it means that the team was very united and worked with
  pleasure, with sacrifice, against everything and everyone because it's very difficult to beat Lisbon.




  We started classes in Largo do Paço, in the room where the post office and the medieval hall are now, we had not yet built
  the pavilions in D.Pedro V. We started classes a year earlier, in February
  1974, two months later came the 24th of April. There were a lot of difficulties. Successes on the one hand and difficulties
  on the other and one of them is that the minister, after the 25th of April 1974, wanted to put an end to the
  new universities, only the Universidade Nova de Lisboa would exist. And we started classes a year early, to have students
  so that our voice could be stronger, because students are a force. And in fact, the idea of ending the University of Minho
  is over. I was one of the first teachers to teach in Largo do Paço, where Public Relations is now located. I gave my first
  class there.




  The idea of building a university in Braga was Veiga Simão's. Veiga Simão, when carrying out the renovation,
Machine Translated by Google
  of universities, in Coimbra, Porto and Lisbon, understood that Braga already had a Faculty of Philosophy and that it was a
  university city, and was one of the most populated parts of Portugal, he placed the university here, in Évora and Covilhã
  and in Vila Real the university institutes, which later became universities. The universities were Porto, Lisbon and
  Minho.



  Fortunately, the first rector, Lloyd Braga, was an exceptional man. The university of Minho is due to him, when in the first
  meeting we had he said:-"We are going to create a complete university. We have no obligation to follow the others." His
  idea of putting the entire university on one campus came from England. And I even wanted a single campus and I didn’t want
  it in Braga. At first, we thought of Barcelos, but the place that was chosen between Braga and Guimarães was Taipas because
  it was a mountain on our own, we could build the entire university there. It turns out that those from Guimarães didn't want it,
  and today they regret it, they wanted something in Guimarães. Viana also did without. As the government forced us
  to stay in Braga and Guimarães, the Army officers sold us Quinta da Armada, where the university is today, for 3,500
  contos. They said: -"As long as they make us a house for the officers in Porto, the price is 3,500 contos." Then they
  regretted it and when we wanted to buy the "conduit" part, they already wanted 50 thousand contos. The land in Guimarães,
  where the university is located, is already

  I was the one who bought them. We didn't want to stay stuck there in the city, today we are already suffocated, as expected,
  but the government forced us. Freitas do Amaral and others forced us to go there. So we stayed in Guimarães and
  Braga.



  In Guimarães, at first we had the Vila Flôr Palace, where we were temporarily, and then we bought the land where the university
  is today. And then the big development was with Professor Machado dos Santos. João de Deus was there for a short time, he
  became Minister of Education, and
  Machado dos Santos was appointed rector. He was there for 10 years. It was the rector who gave great development because
  universities were subsidized depending on the number of students, so it was convenient to have more, at first we even had
  too much, but it was good because it gave us money to build the university.




  An Installation Committee was created, which was composed of prof. Lloyd Braga, prof. Romero, it was me, Pinto Machado,
  who wanted to found the Faculty of Medicine and who is now leading the project to create this faculty at the University of
  Minho. Then there was the director of public works. The secretary who was Dr. Cabral, who is still there. Freitas do Amaral
  stayed for a few months, then got involved in politics and left, but he was one of the first. Pinto Machado had the Faculty of
  Medicine, Professor Romero had the Faculty of Engineering, I had the part of Humanities, Social Sciences and Economics.
  We were these, then Santos Simões came, who is in charge of the university in Guimarães and who replaced Freitas do
  Amaral. Guimarães had a lot of power with the government at that time. But it was lucky, we are still very good
  friends with Santos Simões today, we are still in a relationship with him and now a cultural unit is going to be founded in
  Guimarães and Monção.




  On Thursdays from 9 am until night the Commission met to discuss the university plan and regulations.
  Everything was done by the Installation Committee.



  We wanted a complete university, with all faculties. It was the rector's first idea and we
  we support. We just didn't get Law and Medicine at the time, the others were out there. A
  Engineering is the most developed, even today, because Ultramar engineers came. It was lucky because when the 25th of
  April came, many universities did not want Angolan professors and
  Mozambique because they said they were colonialists. We didn't have that prejudice here because the rector had come
  from there and wasn't a colonialist. So, the engineers all came here. The current dean, I remember very well, arrived there
  one day and dean Lloyd Braga introduced me, he came to Physics Engineering. I mean, the Engineering part is more
  developed today because it soon had a
Machine Translated by Google
  teacher base.


  My section used few teachers because no Humanities teachers came from Ultramar, it was
  necessary to train them, which is why it is lagging behind. Teachers are trained here. The only help we
  had was from the professors who were expelled from the universities, and one of them was Aguiar e Silva
  and Pinto Castro, because they had little connection to the Estado Novo or because they had
  exercised something, the universities kicked them out, but they didn't. It was an official value, that
  is, they were not allowed to be teachers. And we called here. Pinto e Castro later returned to Coimbra,
  with his mother there. But the prof. Aguiar e Silva stayed here, it was our luck. I mean, in fact the
  humanities have been slower because it was necessary to train the teachers themselves. Even now,
  in the 25th year of Literature, I gave a speech about this, those who appeared as assistants, trained in
  the 80s, are now teachers. Then he came, the one who is in charge of the Polytechnic of Viana do
  Castelo, who I knew, and I transferred him to Social Sciences and Economics, he then moved out of
  Economics because Economics was going very badly. So this is how the issue was resolved.


  Today the university has been launched, a safe university, and it has a complete Faculty of Medicine
  and Law. We only lack Music. The prof. Lloyd Braga also wanted the Conservatory to be a university
  level, which was not the case in Lisbon. They told us that first in Lisbon then in Braga. Today they
  already have that there and we here when the IEC leaves there, we plan to put the music conservatory
  there. The IEC moves to Gualtar because they are from Education and everything stays together.


  I was rector when the Commission went from its installation period to its definitive period, which for
  me was a great disappointment because I didn't want it. I had more powers with the installation
  Commission than when the final one passed. It should be the opposite, but in fact it is. I became
  even more dependent on Lisbon. Things that I had to decide before, then I had to go to Lisbon. So the
  transition must have been in the year 1982. The Installation period was from 1974 to 1982. I reached
  the age limit in 1984, so it was in 1983. The same minister who appointed me rector, was the one who passed th
  installation period to the definitive period. From the beginning, the university's facilities were in Largo
  do Paço. We were lucky because Minister Veiga Simão was in charge of Education and Culture and
  had no difficulty in giving the Largo do Paço building and the library to the University of Minho.
  If it were now we wouldn't be able to take care of this. Minho and Coimbra are the only universities
  that have the archive and public library dependent on the university. Other buildings, like the Castle,
  were given to the university on a temporary basis, on a precarious basis as they say, but now it is
  definitive, it belongs to the University of Minho. The Adabe Loureiro building was worth us, which
  was where the Portuguese Legion was located, which they also gave to the University of Minho, now it is definit
  These are the buildings where the university began.


  Then there is D.Pedro V, where we bought two houses, carried out works, and gave some classes there.
  I taught in D.PedroV, as a professor, and I never taught in Gualtar because when I became rector I
  stopped teaching and it was at that time that the facilities moved to Gualtar. So I was a teacher at Largo
  do Paço and at D.Pedro V.


  The courses that the university started were Engineering and Science courses. We had to train our
  own teachers here in Humanities Literature and we started the Portuguese-French and Portuguese-
  English course at the beginning. They were the first courses that advanced. With difficulties, obviously,
  we did not have facilities, teachers were arriving from overseas with degrees in Engineering Sciences
  and practically Humanities, I was the only one. So I had a lot of work to do at that point, with
  pleasure in fact. And then Professor Aguiar e Silva came from Coimbra, he was the one who helped
  us a lot and he was the great animator of the Humanities and Languages courses.
  Today the projects are practically formed, they are already working in full, but these things are not

  they take place suddenly. The courses were then barcharelatos because Lloyd wanted it to be a
  barcharelatos degree and then a licentiate degree. It was an English system, which now they want to put in place.
  degrees because the Ministry of Education did not take advantage of these bachelor-degree themes and it
  was just a degree.


  Engineering, that was, with the Physical-Chemistry, which stayed in the temporary pavilions, known as
  green pavilions, that we built next to Avenida José Manuel da Conceição. Then Physics began,
  Chemistry and Engineering.

  # Interview with Manuel Domingues de Sá




  My name is Manuel Domingues de Sá. I was born on February 8, 1952 in Lordelo, Moure Santa Maria,
  municipality of Amares. I live in Lordelo, it's the place I really like. There are other lands where I wouldn't
  mind living at all, but that one. There is a popular saying from the town of Amares, which says that "One
  place in Bouro is worth more than five in Coimbra."




  My father is Abelino José de Sá and my mother is Alvirinha de Jesus Domingues. My father belongs to
  Amares municipality and my mother belonged to the Terras do Bouro municipality, therefore
  neighboring municipalities. My paternal grandparents are from the municipality of Amares, in the same
  parish where I live, Moure - Santa Maria, and my maternal grandparents are from the municipality of Terras do Bou


  My father was a foreman, a small foreman. At that time there were no machines, almost everything was
  manual. As it was hard work, I didn't want to follow his profession. It's not that the current profession I have
  is very easy, which it isn't, but I left it. I didn't want to take over my business
  father because he thought it was hard.


  My father is a very good person, but of course at the moment my father is seventy-something years old,
  he is a difficult person, he is used to his time, and he doesn't give up. When I didn't agree to continue
  with the firm, my father had a reaction between his teeth, he saw that he had more children and it was
  almost like the other says - "This is the oldest and the others are around here." But he liked me a lot and didn't cu
  legs, said: - "You want to go, go."


  My mother is more liberal, she is another person identical to my father except that my father was a person
  who studied, in his time he could almost have been a teacher, and my mother is illiterate.


  I have six siblings, three brothers and three sisters. The oldest is called Custódia Maria Domingues de
  Sá, next to her I am Manuel Domingues de Sá, my other brother is Fernando Domingues de Sá, then another
  girl, so this was all alternated, Teresa Domingues de Sá then I have another brother, António Domingues
  de Sá and I am missing my sister, Maria Amélia Domingues de Sá.
  So there are six of us.




  I was born in Lordelo, spent my childhood there and continue to live there.

  The relationship between my brothers was good, we never had any problems. I mean, my oldest sister and I, next to me who
  is two years apart, don't deal with our younger brothers because they are seven years apart from us. My sister and I then
  went our way and they stayed at home. Therefore, the relationship with my brothers was when I went home to spend the
  weekend with my parents, we spent time together. It was a joy. Other than that I wasn't there.




  My older sister had the housework, and I did little at home because we also had land, and our job was to work on the
  land. For example, when I was at home it was up to me to go with the animals and my sister normally stayed at home and
  that's what we did. At home, it was practically my mother and my sister who did things. When I worked with my father,
  during breaks I helped with farming, the small farming we had.




  ## Study by candlelight ##




  I started with primary school. At that time there was no pre-school and I started in primary school and went to fourth grade
  and then I didn't want to continue studying. Then, as I thought it was really not enough, I started studying, but at my own
  expense. I didn't want to study at my father's expense. I went from first to fourth grade and then left. There were also
  no schools like there are today, you had to come here to Braga, 26 kilometers away. At that time, there were difficulties and
  so I gave up, I mean, I took the fourth class and gave up. Then I wanted to continue and studied at my own expense, I
  was 16 or 17 years old. I started studying at night in private classes.




  I remember that the teacher assigned me normal tasks and I liked doing a lot more. And then, there was a problem, there
  was no electricity in my area. Electric light only appeared in 63 or 68, I was still in third class. And so, I studied by
  candlelight and did my homework at night, sometimes four in the morning and five in the morning and I got up, precisely

  because I knew I had to do it. It was a bit difficult, but I really liked school, I must say, and so my greatest vocation was
  Mathematics.



  The relationship with my classmates at school was a reasonable relationship. There were good children and bad children.
  I have the impression that I shouldn't be one of the good ones, but anyway I liked my corner and had my friends selected for
  my games.



  I wanted to be, and still today I would like to be, a teacher. This never happened and now it's too late. I wanted to be a teacher
  because I liked school, I liked the school environment, but I had difficulty pursuing my studies at that time. To continue
  studying, I had to come to Braga, travel around 26 kilometers, and my parents were average people. My father was a
  construction foreman, he had his salary, the salary of a worker, sometimes he took a little extra, and therefore I had no chance
  of continuing to study, if I continued it would be bad for my parents. I stopped studying because at the start
Machine Translated by Google
  I knew that my parents might not have the opportunity to send me to study because I had to come to
  Braga, I had to find a place to live, and I thought there was no chance.


  Later I studied in private classes. I completed the second year, which at the time was the sixth, then I
  studied to try to complete the ninth, I even took some subjects at the Sá de Miranda school, which I
  thought went badly for me at the time, and I didn't even find out the results. . And then one of the
  subjects, which I thought was easy, even said: "It's in the conversation!" I failed by half the amount and therefo
  I was so disappointed after failing that I didn't want to see the others. But it gives me the impression
  that I later managed to find out, through A and B, that I had really failed and then I couldn't continue.




  I'm married, I got married at 28 years old. I started dating and didn't happen to get married sooner. I met
  my wife a year before and got married in 1980. I have a boy and a girl. My oldest son is 19 years old
  and the girl is 13 years old. They are studying and I am encouraging them to continue as far as they can.



  I'm not very modern. When it comes to household activities, my wife takes care of most of that, I
  I help her to do certain things, for example, to cook, but not much because she was never used
  to it. During my mother's time, I was never used to it. I also have my children and they help with the
  housework and, therefore, I am practically free.


 I have normal interactions at home when we are together at lunch. At lunch it's not every day, it's only
 when I'm not working, but especially at dinner we socialize a lot. Of course they have their sports, they
 like games that I no longer know. There are a lot of things that they know, games, and I don't and,
 therefore, I no longer agree, they do. It's not that I didn't like it, but it doesn't catch my attention, so
 sometimes they ask me to do this or that, those sports, and I say: - "No, no, you entertained
 yourself." That's our life, it's a good relationship. They also take after their father, they are very calm.




  None of my brothers wanted to follow my father's firm, perhaps because the eldest didn't follow a
  certain path, and the others didn't follow either. That was my case, in fact it was the case of my
  brothers, who all followed me, they all followed in my footsteps. I started working in the hotel industry,
  at that time, it was a profession that had many attractions, we were always clean, always
  impeccable, and my brothers ended up following in my footsteps. My sisters followed their paths, they
  have different professions, they are liberal and they work for them.


  Leaving my parents' house was very difficult, very difficult. I left the house, that was it; 15 years old, I
  left school when I was 11, I didn't miss a single year, then I worked with my father, on my father's
  construction site, then I have the impression that it was when I was 15/16 that I left home. So, I worked
  with my father, so I was aware of the environment, and when it came to that point I left home, with the
   my father's permission. The person who took me to work in the hotel industry was a neighbor of mine
  and my father was more relaxed, but it was very difficult for me, because I was used to always living
  with my parents since I was born. Honestly, when I started working I cried at night several times.
Machine Translated by Google

  Then I came to Braga. I updated myself, I took the courses that were mandatory in the hotel industry at the time, I took my
  exams, I took a course that gave me second-class professional status and I didn't go any further because I needed a
  language.



  The University of Minho was a real surprise for me. As I had, at the time, my studies and I reached the ninth grade, it
  already gave me access to join the bank, and I applied to all the banks without exception. And then, some of the banks
  sent me a form to register, including Banco de Portugal. Then I was called by Crédito Predial Português bank and they
  sent me to take tests in Porto. I went to take tests in Porto, and I'm convinced that I was fine because, right away, they
  called me to go to psychological tests in Lisbon and I went to take psychological tests in Lisbon. Honestly, they
  were very difficult, they started at 8 am until 6 pm, we only had an hour for lunch. There were eight of us who were taking
  the psychological tests and I am convinced that there was no one better than me. I had already packed my bag to go to the
  bank, when they told me that everyone who had gone to take the tests in Lisbon had failed. He was



  a big surprise for me.



  I knew some people who worked at a bank and I told them how things were and they said: - "Hey man, you did more
  than we did!" What happened is that I ended up not getting into the bank.




  Then there was my entry to university, which came by invitation. They arrived at my side:
  - "Do you want to go to university?", and I said: - "Oh, I wish". I had gone through that disappointment and I was very
  touched by it. And that's it, they told me to go to university and I signed up.
  When the cantinas opened, in 1980, I joined. I joined the canteen in January 1980, I had already
  an open bar, but I joined the canteen, not as a cook but as a kitchen assistant. I had another privilege to go back and start
  from the bottom up.



  My day-to-day work was wonderful because we were just starting out and there were few employees and few
  students, and there was a great friendship between colleagues, teachers and students. We all knew each other.
  Nowadays it is no longer possible, it is very difficult to recognize everyone.



  The relationship with colleagues was good, very good. Even today, from far away, I meet a teacher, who was a student
  at the time, and he is a joy. When we meet: - "Hey, Mr. Sá!"
  I mean, and sometimes I don't even know their names, I've forgotten. But it's funny that they actually know me a
  lot. I have this privilege.



  Even today I have colleagues who joined me and who are still working at the University of Minho. We are the first to
  enter the canteen: the chef, Mr. Cerqueira, we have the main cook in the current kitchen, Abílio, Toni, who works at
  CEFOP, and there were people who have already
  they reformed. I hope that memory does not betray my colleagues, but I think that currently it is just those, the three of
  us, not forgetting Mr Osório, who is the administrator of Social Action.



  At the moment, I'm responsible for the CPII bar and I have a cousin who works there, but I don't recognize any employee.
  We are all like brothers there, in fact, I try to make sure people are all equal, there is no privilege at all. Inside we are
  nobody, we are all the same.
Machine Translated by Google
 I really like my profession, but honestly we live in a world that is always modernizing and I would also like to be
 more modern. If I were to leave there, I would like to go to a better service. My dream was to be a teacher, but I also like
 computers, if there was a place where I could work on computers or anything else, I would honestly leave university.
 It's the problem of modernity, or else, we often take these training courses where there could be a chance for
 us to move up, that was my case, that's what I wanted. In addition to liking what I do, I really like doing things well, at least
 I try my best to do them well.

  ## Single Adventures ##




  The memories I have of Braga are from when I was single, living here in Braga, there were some
  four or five friends and we would leave work and go for a walk there, a few there and so on. We only did stupid things, but
  decent ones, the kind that people actually remember and laugh about.




  We went to Bom Jesus a lot. I worked at the Frankford Hotel, I left at three o'clock and then only came in at six o'clock,
  and then we would pick up and always go to Bom Jesus. We would like to go to Bom Jesus. And then, everyone already
  knew us because we were very similar and we always hung out together. And at that time, we had a friend there
  who also worked at Bom Jesus, who was a waiter at Sul Americano, and one of those times we went to the boats, we
  asked the gentleman if we could go on the boats and he left us there. We got on the boats and stuff, we walked

  what we wanted. We arrived at a certain point, left the boat at the other end of the lake, left and didn't pay. Of course
  we can't come the right way, we came by shortcuts
  down there. But we knew that, from the outset, this guy who was our friend who worked there
Machine Translated by Google
 would pay.



  ## Rapid growth ##




  The University of Minho operated separately. At the time, people said that there were facilities in Gulbenkian,
  others in the Castle, others that operated in Abade da Loureira, and later there on the banks of São Geraldo. The university
  was a little broken. Now it's all fixed.




  I was working in Santa Tecla, when the facilities opened here in Gualtar. As the university grew in size, the relationship with
  students and teachers changed and was never the same again. We used to have more space to talk, to meet people.
  Not now because there are so many students now and if we manage to retain one, tomorrow we will forget about him
  because there are so many. However, I continued to have a good relationship with everyone, not only with students
  and teachers, but with everyone, colleagues and everything, that's my way. I recognize that I'm a bit closed off, but I like
  to get along with everyone, in fact, I insist on that and I like it.




  I remember the inauguration of the Santa Tecla cantina, which had a big impact on me because the relationships were
  wider and we all worked well. We all worked there together serving the men. It was the first inauguration that the university
  had, at the time, as its own facility.



  ## Quiet life ##




 In the morning I get up, go to work and spend the whole day at the university. Normally, I get up around 8 am or
 7:45 am to be here at 9 am. Then, at night I leave here, go home, have dinner and don't leave the house. I never leave the
 house at night, only if there is some reason that forces me to leave. I do this every day. On Saturday I'm home.




  My life continues to be a peaceful one, I try to take everything very well and not go any further.
  Trying to get everything right in life, so that everything goes well.


  I'm a very calm person, very quiet, I'm not a person who makes friends very quickly, it's not that I have anything against
  people and they against me, I mean, I'm not a person who makes friends very easily. I am a friend of my friend, I really
  like my friends and I value my friends very much.
  friends, but I don't have the inclination to go anywhere to find a friend, it's a bit difficult.
  The friendships I made happened naturally.



  ## Family value ##




  In my leisure time, I often sleep, because we leave here, when it's time for classes,
Machine Translated by Google
  quite tired, the university here has a lot of students. I really like being with my family.
  I'm a very calm person, I like to be quiet and so I look for certain refuges, I stay at home. I can go to a cafe on
  Saturday, but if I go there, I'm not there for more than an hour. I really like being at home with my family. We are all at
  home, we all had lunch, dinner
  everyone, there are no exceptions except for a party for one of the kids, but normally we are always at home. I really
  like the family. After that, I have my parents who live close to me. I have my in-laws who also live nearby, six kilometers
  away.




  I would like Benfica to be champions and to see my children graduate, to continue their studies and for everything to go well,
  and to achieve what I would like them to achieve, which was to graduate. I have already told some colleagues that my
  greatest pleasure was seeing my children here at university, both as students and teachers. That's my biggest
  wish, but anyone would like that. Of course, if one day they came here I would be distant from them, they would
  become adults, they would take their place and I would take mine.




  For me it would be a disappointment if I saw them in the same profession as their father. I dream that they fly higher.




  I would like to travel, now everyone says they like to travel, I also liked that and many things.
  I really enjoy living my day-to-day life, but always thinking about tomorrow and the day beyond.



  I would like to be a teacher but I think that now becoming a teacher is impossible, it would take many years. What I always
  thought about was studying. Last year I enrolled to continue my studies, but then they failed because there were no
  students arriving. These
  Classes were to be given in my location.



  Really being a teacher was a dream but moving out of town every day is very boring. I already travel from my town to
  Braga, back and forth every day. If I were to study, for example, in my closest location, which would be Amares, I would
  be subject to greater wear and tear and other expenses. I would love to continue studying, if it was in my area, I would
  love it. Now, I don't have a chance because at my age I'm not going to get away with it.




  I think teaching is a very dignified profession and I also think it's very beautiful. As I was a very good Mathematics
  student, it was natural for me to go into Mathematics. I would like to be a teacher, it's just another old desire.

  # Interview with Paula Maria
   da Silva Anjo




  My name is Paula Maria da Silva Anjo. I was born in Angola, on June 2, 1968. My father is Modesto Moreira Anjo and my
  mother is Maria de Lurdes Carlos Silva Anjo. I have four brothers, three boys and one girl. My grandfather, on my mother's
  side, died two years ago and on my father's side, they are both alive. I live in Parretas, in Braga.

  Since I came from Angola, I have always lived in the city of Braga. I came from Angola when I was 7 years old. I don't
  have many memories of Angola, nor of my childhood because when I came from there it was war time and I think it
  completely swept away things from me when I was little. I remember the war and I don't remember my childhood.




  ## Alone at the station ##




  One thing that stuck in my memory when we came from Angola was arriving in Porto and taking the train
  from Porto station to Nine. We arrived at Nine at night and my mother had no one waiting for her, she
  didn't know where to turn. We sat on the benches at the station, the three of us, my mother, me and my
  brother older than me by a year, and we all started crying.
  We wanted to eat, we wanted to sleep, we had nowhere to go. My mother didn't know how to go to my
  grandmother. I knew that my grandmother lived in Nine, but I didn't know the right place. And then a
  couple of gentlemen, very old, saw us crying and saw my mother desperate, and offered to walk
  looking for my grandmother.


  We spent a year or two at Nine, until my mother found a house in Braga. Afterwards, when we found a
  place, we came to Braga. The house was in Nogueira, at the foot of Quinta da Capela, whoever goes to
  Sameiro, it was close to the university, which was where my mother worked.


  >The memories I have of Braga are Rua de São João do João do Souto. I remember that part about frying
  pans. At school, I remember a teacher who was a bit strict, if you saw her you wouldn't
  I knew her, but I fixed that, nothing more.


  ## Boarding schools ##




  At school we played in Celeste's garden, with the wheel, with the rope, sometimes we did some mischief there and
  the nuns punished me at night. For example, when I slept in the afternoon, they wouldn't let me go to the
  playground, it had to be removed. Other times they cut me off from sweets, things like that. We always had
  fixed hours for studying and catechesis, there was a lot of rigor.


  I finished school in Taipas, then I went to school on Rua Santa Margarida, opposite Sá de Miranda. I did
  my entire school career in schools. I remember I was at the seminary for a while and I also remember
  going to São João do Souto school in primary school. Then I moved to school. That's why I spent some
  time in Braga, while there was no school in Guimarães, I was in Braga in those early days.




  On the weekends, I took the bus to Braga, home and helped my mother in the kitchen to make cakes,
  which I liked to make cakes. I helped clean up and sometimes went out. I very rarely asked to go out. I was
  more of a homebody, I liked staying at home watching TV or playing. My brothers didn't go to school and I
  always missed them a lot.

  I think that going to schools, the fact that I couldn't go out and talk to people made me a more isolated person. I think that,
  even today, I isolate myself a lot because I already have a lot of confidence, but everyone asks me why, outside of
  university, I am always alone or with my daughter. I never go out with my husband or anyone else, I'm always alone. I think
  I was a
  a bit distant, isolated, because of going to school.



  I can't say that the education I had was very strict because I liked it. Now I like it more than I liked it in high school. At that
  time, what I wanted was to get out of there, but thinking about it, reflecting what I went through there, I liked what I was
  doing there for many years.



  My intention was to take a Gymnastics course. The career I would like to pursue was gymnastics, the kind of jumping,
  because I love the sport. I loved seeing those gymnasts, those floor jumps. I still studied sports for a year, then my mother
  said that the sports course was more for men, it didn't look good on a woman. At that time, they said that sport wasn't for
  women to follow, sport was for men and my mother didn't let me follow it. I then opted for another course, left sport and
  went to another.




  I met my husband at the Red Cross. I was taking the First Aid course, which I gave up when they told me I had to prepare
  for cuts, to help accident victims and things like that, and I think I didn't have the courage and gave up. I only spent two
  months there, and I met my husband there.
  We started leaving and ready. We dated two years. I met his family, I liked the family and we got together.




  I have been married for seven years. I have a girl, Bruna Filipa Anjo Dias, four and a half years old, without me counting. It
  wasn't planned because I have a 10-year-old sister, who was born out of time, who was raised by me, she's my little girl.
  Then when I got married I said I didn't want to have any more children because taking care of my sister gave me a lot of
  work. I got up in the morning with her screaming that she didn't want to get dressed. I would dress her and she would
  undress, she would go to school in her pajamas and the nuns would then dress her, and I would say: "I never want
  children again." But I'm glad my daughter came, or never again.




  When I got married, I left my parents' house. I cried so much that wedding day, I cried, and my father said - "Don't get
  married!". It took a lot for me to get used to married life. I missed my mother, I missed my father, my brothers. I didn't
  feel alone because my husband was always by my side, I just missed the company of my parents and siblings. On top of
  that, that little sister of mine, at the wedding, wouldn't let go of me, afraid that I would leave. My marriage has been, as
  married people always say - "If I knew, I wouldn't get married." I think everyone says that. We just want to get married
  so that we can say that later, we want to experience it and then say that. Married life is different. I think we don't have
  as much freedom as we do when we're single. When a person wants to go somewhere, we have to tell their husband, if
  we don't tell them they get upset. AND
Machine Translated by Google
  Differently, if a person wants to buy anything, outside of their budget, they have to say - "Can you
  buy it?" Is different! Whereas as a single woman we did what we wanted. However, I
  consider myself independent.


  ## Second home ##




  I entered the University in 1987 or 88, I was studying, I applied for experience, I was getting
  used to applying for the Civil Service and the next thing I knew I was accepted, then I had to choose
  between continuing to study or starting to work and I chose start working. I didn't have the 12th year
  yet, I only had the 10th year incomplete. I only finished Year 12 a year or two ago. I resumed my studies be
  There were so many people applying for University with their 12th grade and I always had an incomplete 10th grade and I decid
  - "It has to be now or I'll fall behind in the competitions." Because it could harm my
  professional life. I went to take a training course, at IAP, in Porto and I told my superiors and
  swore to myself that I would never try to find courses here in Braga, computer courses here in
  Braga. I'm still doing that free training in Gualtar right now. Whenever I go to Gualtar I'm ready
  and want to go and take courses, now to Porto, never again. It's a lot of confusion, a lot is lost
  time, a person to go there for the course. In restaurants or other places like that, I would get lost.
  Once I got lost on a street, I went down a street to find a restaurant, then I didn't know where I
  was, I didn't know how to go to the course site.


  We employees are always updating ourselves. We never know everything, we always have things to
  learn and, on top of that, computers, we are always learning new things every day.
  I think it's a service that's a bit monotonous if we don't diversify it a little more.
  I mean, I do a lot of things, that's why I like to do a lot of things. Sometimes I can be overwhelmed
  but I like to do it because I don't like to always have that anxiety - "Just do this?" No. I like to have
  a lot of things to do so I vary it.


  My first role at the university was in the Secretariat of the School of Engineering, working with Mr.
  Falcão. The installations were in pavilions next to the highway swimming pools, called Green
  Pavilions. That was a bit horrible, it felt like a prison. It was all in blocks, it didn't look like a university.
  When I got there and looked at the pavilions I was amazed at what the university facilities were like.
  That was temporary and rented. I was there for about five years working.


  I enjoyed working with Falcão, I learned a lot of things, he was a good boss, a lot of things about my work
  I owe him. Then I went to D. Pedro V and only then did I come to Gualtar. I did the paperwork,
  everything that had to be done on the bureaucratic side, and that came from When I worked with
  Falcão, the work environment was different because there was someone above me, there was the
  head of the secretariat who told me what I needed to do. do what I didn't have to do. Not now. I am not regu


  There was a story that happened to me, I had recently entered university. Falcão told me to go to
  the Physics Pavilion, opposite, which had a security system. At that time it already had a
  security system because it had been robbed several times and Dr. Teresa Isabel Ferreira implemented
  a security system on the doors. Falcão sent me to get some papers and I tried to enter that pavilion.
  The door was open, I went in to meet the person. Soon Dr. Isabel appears to me - "What are you
  doing here?" Take my shirt and take me outside. He didn't let me speak. I wanted to explain to her,
  and she just said - "There's nothing that
Machine Translated by Google
  be here?" He chased me out of the pavilion. Then I went to Falcão and explained to him. After a
  while, Dr. Isabel entered our pavilion, saw me in the office and asked me - "Oh, you're the one who
  employee?" And I - "Yes I am." "Then why didn't you tell me?" "He didn't let me explain, he
  immediately pulled me out into the street." It was a funny scene.




  I remember when I went to the IT department, they took me to Professor Valença, I cried
  so much, I cried because I didn't want to go to a department with a lot of people and most of them men.
  I was afraid to adapt to this department. Professor Valença was very friendly, he showed me
  around the offices and introduced me to the staff.




  The work environment was spectacular, I just didn't like the work place because it wasn't very
  good. A person would reach the end of the day and feel physically and mentally very exhausted.
  Now in relation to this workplace, here it is much more spacious, natural light, artificial light. There
  no, there was no window, there was nothing, it was a hole, a very cramped, very small office, but I
  was there for a short time.


  The IT Department began operating next to Gulbenkian, in the Green Pavillions, after D.Pedro V.
  The IT Center was also at D.Pedro V, during the professor's time.
  Mário Neves as director is no longer in my time. In my time, the director was Professor Valença, and
  so on, then we came to Gualtar.


  I slowly started to adapt to the department and Professor Valença also helped me to see that in
  that department people got along well, that I would be well received, that everything would go well
  and then he started asking me for things. little bits asked me to take care of this, to take care of that.
  I started to get into the mechanism and then it was always easier, I started asking for more
  complicated, more difficult things and then I started to like it.


  The size of the university was very different from today, even in the department itself. I started to like
  the department so much that I opened a bar for the teachers. I was the one who managed the bar,
  who went to get fresh things in the morning and the drinks.




  When moving from a general secretariat to a department secretariat, changes were immediately
  noticed in terms of space, which is very important to make me feel better, but before we came here,
  we were still there working alongside the Mathematics Department. It was a better place than in
  D.PedroV, there was more space in the office, there were windows, it was better, it already had better mater
  Professor Valença also immediately bought what I wanted, he wanted an IMAC, a Macintoch, to make
  me feel good. He bought the best everything.


  What I liked most when we came to Gualtar was the fact that things were closer to me. For example,
  if I needed to take care of something at Academic Services, I would walk. I needed to go to some
  department and so I went. I didn't need to put things in the mail. I started to move more, I wasn't
  sitting there for so long, I moved more and got things done faster
Machine Translated by Google
  than in D.PedroV.




  I think I've also been more talkative to my colleagues at work. I think over time
  I withdraw more, I close myself off more, because it has to do with the service. When I have more
  work I don't talk to them as much, and sometimes they start to imagine - "Maybe she's in trouble,
  she's angry and we didn't do anything to her." But it is not! I'm the one who isolates myself a
  bit to try to concentrate, to try to get the job done. And sometimes when I reflect at night on
  what happened during the day, I find myself thinking - "I said so little today with my colleagues,
  with Cristina and Helena. Maybe they'll think I'm angry and I'm not. " It's up to a person to isolate themselv
  a person is angry and not with everyone.


  Currently, I already know what it's like, and I do it. It comes from the director, the boss, they just
  tell me they want this and that and I do it. In addition to serving students and teachers, I
  also hire staff, new teachers who join. I do so much! I don't get along very well with students,
  that's why I'm now taking the Customer Service Function Course, to have a bit more calm and
  patience with students. But I deal more directly with the teachers, part of the bureaucracy, all that
  paperwork, the trips they make and the master's degrees, even with the master's degrees. It's like
  administrative support, like a secretary, except I'm a secretary for a large group of people.



  Students sometimes ask questions - "Is that teacher there and not here? And what time does he
  come?" It seems like we have to know the teacher's schedule, when he's here, when he's not
  it is. The students put a lot of pressure on us in that part. They understand that we almost have
  to know about the teacher's life, we have to know if he's coming here tomorrow, if he's here. I try to
  explain it to the student, but sometimes it's difficult to understand. We have no obligation
  to know where the teacher is.

  ## Sport and work ##




  I swim, now less frequently because I have hearing problems and the doctor advised me to swim less. I still do a few
  gymnastics things. I used to do aerobics but I also gave up. I have a lot of flexibility. I like gymnastics and the exercises
  we do help us maintain flexibility. Whenever I can, I go for a run. I like going up the steps of Bom Jesus, sometimes I don't
  have company, but I also go alone. But now with the years upon us, we start to need company. I think it's with the
  mother going, it's because the mother works in the field and needs her children's help. The single daughters are the ones
  with her and then the married sons are the ones who have to go and help their mother.




  In addition to sport, I really liked reading. I wish I liked reading myself. Reading is good for us. I think we learn a lot from
  reading, not just from watching television. My problem is that I don't like reading, I don't think I like reading. I would like
  to read it but I don't. It bothers me to be reading. I buy a book, read one or two pages, then sit down. Sometimes I buy it to
  encourage myself, to motivate myself -
  "I'm going to read this book", but I only read one or two pages.



  Right now, the most important activity in my life is work. I put work above everything, sometimes even above family. I'm one
  of those people who say - "I don't like putting off until tomorrow what I can do today." And then I like to do everything.
  Sometimes people say that things are done badly because we want to do everything, everything, everything. And now in
  this era with the rooms, the schedules, I don't even sleep well.




  ## Stressful life ##




  I left the house, just yesterday I got caught in a big mess taking my daughter to school. I'm too lazy to get up. It's a good
  thing that in the public service I don't punch in, I don't punch in, because if I punched in, my dot would always be red. Both
  entering and leaving. If a person leaves after that time, it also turns red. I know because my mother used to bite. I don't mind
  being here until 8/9 at night, but coming in early is the worst thing anyone could do to me. Professor Pedro Henriques said it
  best: - "Try to come at 9 o'clock." Me - "Okay, professor, I'll try but I won't promise anything." It's so difficult to get
  up, the part that costs me the most is getting up. But I usually get up at 8 o'clock, dress the girl. It's hard for me to leave
  the house without having breakfast, but that's what happens at breakfast, then I take the girl to school, and sometimes I get
  here irritated because she keeps crying, she doesn't want to stay at school. I arrive at the university around 9:45 am,
  10 am is my arrival time. Then I stay here all morning, sometimes I have lunch here, have some sandwiches and continue
  until 8 pm.

  My husband, at night it's up to him to go look for his daughter. Sometimes she asks me to pick her
  up and I pick her up. But I don't want to get her used to it because she comes here for work, then she gets used to
  wants to come to and I don't want her to get used to it. Then I dress her in the morning and she also wants
  to come to my work. I've already brought her twice and then she got used to coming here in the morning
  and then, I cut it off, I stopped picking her up from school. At the end of school he goes to my mother-in-law.


  I usually have dinner at my mother-in-law's, which is good, that's why I stay here until 8, eight or so and
  then I go to my mother-in-law's. From time to time, I do extra work here, those private jobs. I don't
  have a computer at home, so I work here. I have the resources here, I'm going to do some work. Then I
  pick up the girl and we go home at 10 pm. Now I go earlier to get her used to sleeping earlier, we leave at
  9:30 pm and go home. I have a T3, which we bought three years before the wedding.




  My life today is very stressful. For example, I can't sleep these days because of the schedule. I only see
  rooms, I only see I don't know what, it seems like I'm making timetables in my memory, building timetables
  and more rooms for here and there. This time of year at the beginning of the year is really stressful,
  then there are the contracts to be made. The teacher just yesterday asked why the contract hadn't
  been done and I still have others to complete.


  ## Fear of driving ##




  There was one thing in my life that really impacted me, it was when I started driving the car I was already
  scared, and many people ask me why I have a third in the car. And I say I have the rosary in the car
  because when I drove the mini, in the first month, I had two accidents. I got scared and then didn't want to
  ride in a car. I walked there for a few months without walking and that was what marked me. I even
  memorized the song that my daughter was singing when I hit - "There are no stars in the sky to worship
  my path.". The first time it wasn't my fault, but in the second accident, with a new car, a Yugo that wasn't
  even a month old, it was a serious blow. The first time I left Braga I immediately crashed my car. Then I
  didn't leave Braga with the car for a while.


  ## Health and travel ##




  My biggest wish for my daughter is that she follows her profession, that she pursues what she likes
  most, that she can fulfill her professional dream, like I couldn't, at least that she can.
  Every mother likes to have a son with a degree. What mother doesn't you like to have? Even my mother
  wanted me to go to university. Even so, he still often says - "Run, run." Everyone likes to have
  children with university degrees. I don't run because if I run here for university I already know that most of
  the time I won't go to classes, because I dedicate myself too much to work and I already know that I
  won't go to classes. In terms of gymnastics, I've already given up, I don't know how to do pyroletes anymore. What
  What worries me now is being healthy, which is the main thing. With health you get money. What
  worries me most is having health to pay off debts, the house and the car.


  My biggest wish is to see everyone happy. I liked to travel, although I'm afraid of planes, but I liked to
  travel. One of my dreams is to go to Madeira, it's a place I would like to go. I still have
Machine Translated by Google
 Save some money to go to Madeira, it must be a very beautiful place. I would like to travel and speak English, French not
 so much, but I like English, but I would like to speak French, German, all languages. I think it's cute. @corpus\VascoFreitas.md

 Interview with Vasco Luís Freitas




  My name is Vasco Luís Barbosa de Freitas. I'm 52 years old. I was born in Lisbon. At that time, my father
  I had finished my Mining Engineering course and had gone to Mozambique to work with my grandfather, who was director
  of Mozambique's mining services. My father was in Mozambique when I was born and my mother was in Lisbon.




  When I was three months old I went to Mozambique where I stayed until I was seven years old. Then at the age of seven I came
  to Lisbon, where I took the third class exam; the fourth class; the first year of high school and the second year and in 1960,
  in December, I went to Mozambique again. When I first came to Portugal, I came with my whole family, because my father had
  to go to work in Spain and I stayed in Lisbon, with my mother and my two sisters, studying for five years.




  My father had many field trips, many, and sometimes for long periods because there were geology campaigns, in
  various places, and he had to go out often. My sisters are younger than me, three years apart and they were both born in
  Mozambique. In 1960, I returned with the whole family to Mozambique and we stayed there until my parents left, again,
 in 1969.




  My father has already passed away and my mother is in Lisbon, lives there. My parents have always lived in Lisbon, but
  my origins are from Ponte de Lima, they are remote origins, they come from my great-grandparents and, therefore, both my
  grandparents and my parents have always lived in Lisbon. My parents descend from the "Abreu e Lima", which are ancient
  families from the Ponte de Lima region, Alto-Minho and as my parents are first cousins, they are both "Abreu e Lima". They are
  first cousins because their mothers are sisters, my two grandmothers were sisters, and they were "Abreu e Lima", they
  were daughters of a gentleman called Pedro de Abreu e Lima, who in turn was the son of an Abreu e Lima who was
  Sergeant Major of the Royal Guard, in Lisbon, then the family went there and these two or three generations passed and it was
  lost
  contact here with the north. They always remained cousins and other relatives, but there is nothing to tie them together.
  my parents here in Minho.




  I lived in the capital, in Lourenço Marques, at the time, it was called Maputo, I lived there. From the time I was a few months
  old until I was six or seven years old, I often traveled with my father around Mozambique, because he was in the
  countryside and I spent many months camping with him and with my mother. Camping was an extraordinary adventure. A five/
  six year old kid who might like nothing more than freedom, walking in the countryside and the woods, was fantastic. And
  then, naturally, from then on, my life was always in the capital, basically, in Lourenço Marques, both high school and university.




  ## The fascination of candles ##

  The memories I have of Mozambique are the memories that people normally have of their roots because, although I was born
  in Lisbon and spent some years of my youth there, therefore,
  those first years of high school, most of my life was spent in Mozambique until 1974. The memories I have, first of all, are the
  memories and affection that a person has of their roots. I remember very well the house where I lived when I was little, as it
  was the place and time of my roots, of my youth and these are memories that, I think, remain most engraved in my
  memory.




  I had many friends in Mozambique: high school friends, neighborhood friends, friends from the Academic Association,
  friends from sailing, sports, the Naval Club, where I spent many hours, many days. When I was around twelve/
  thirteen years old, the My father bought me a small sailing boat so I could sail alone. The taste for sailing came from my
  father and grandfather. My grandfather was always an advocate of water sports, healthy sports, and my father, for that
  reason, had
  I also did sailing when I was a kid and started again when I was little. My father, at the time, was a boat. It wasn't like
  board, these 'windsurfing' boards, it was taller, it was a boat with two sails, and he bought me a board with two sails, a big
  I spent hours and hours, going to the Club Naval, taking the candles under my arms, it was still a long descent from my house
  to the Club Naval. And on the weekends, I would grab the sails of the boat, go there, set the sails, go to sea, go to the far
  bay, alone out there and spend hours and hours sailing. In Lourenço Marques there is a big bay, which is where the
  Maputo River flows, and it has a huge bay and I spent a lot of good times there, I went through a lot of risks, a lot of storms
  and I capsized the boat many times in the middle of the bay but I got away there. , I did a lot of regattas. I've been through
  several moments of distress. As I said, I had a small boat, then when I was older, I was 16/17 years old, I bought a SNAC, a
  bigger boat for two people. I did regattas and some competitions there and went boating.




  In 1969, my parents left Mozambique and went to Angola and then in 1971, they left Angola and came to Portugal, and I
  stayed in Mozambique. I did my military service in Mozambique and it was there that I met my wife, whom I married in 1970. I
  met her in high school, in my 7th year, in my final year, which is now equivalent to my 12th, and she was a year ago, she was in
  the sixth. She was born in Mozambique, but was the daughter of Portuguese parents, here from the Beira-Alta
  area and who also went there many years ago, in 1950.




  ## Overseas War ##




  I had finished my degree when I was called up to the troops, in August 1973, at that time, the overseas war was going
  on, so I have a lot of memories of the war.




  I joined the troops, was recruited and then was placed in Tete, in the interior of Mozambique, where the
  war operations. I was posted there as a soldier and never had any problems with food shortages.
  The military had its logistics.

  I was in Mozambique doing military service when the 25th of April occurred, which caused all those
  convulsions, which had an impact on the Portuguese military who were in the overseas war, who finally
  abandoned control of the situation, and my main concern, at that time , it was my family who was in
  Lourenço Marques. I came to think that they were in a worse situation than me in terms of military
  operations. So the family, my wife and my eldest daughter, who had been born in the meantime, left
  alone. They returned to Portugal in October 1974, my eldest daughter was one and a half years old.




  During the entire period I was in Mozambique, almost 20 years, I only came to Portugal twice, once on
  vacation, when I was 18-19 years old. The journey from Mozambique to Portugal, initially, when I
  was seven years old, was by boat, on packet boats, and then by plane.


  So I did my military service in Mozambique and spent a few more months there after the 25th of April.
  However, Mozambique's independence was scheduled and I left the troops because I was recruited in
  Mozambique and, although I was a Portuguese soldier, the prospect was that I would be demobilized
  from the troops in Mozambique. I was originally from Portugal, a Portuguese soldier, but I had been
  recruited in Mozambique and I was left there as a civilian, to take care of my own things. At that time
  I tried to leave, they released me from the troops and I came to Portugal as a civilian. When I returned to
  Portugal, my wife had already been here for a few months.


  I landed in Lisbon, on March 11, 1975. It was on that day that problems occurred with the rallies, with the
  Infantry Regiment near the airport, those convulsions here in Lisbon, where there were those air raids on
  the rallies, those shots. So, I left one war and ended up in another, but it wasn't a problem at all.

  ## Difficulty getting a job ##




  My wife had found some teaching hours at a high school in Oeiras, so I was teaching a few hours, I was
  earning four contos a month, at the time, it was enough for us to have money in our pockets and to
  live on. Then I was looking for a job during the months of March, April and
Machine Translated by Google
  May, in Lisbon and in various parts of the country, in Aveiro and Porto.


  By the time I finished the course, in Mozambique, I had been hired as an assistant at the university, in
  Lourenço Marques. I had been a monitor at the university during the last years of my course. Being an
  assistant was practically a continuation but it was for a short time, two or three months, because then I
  went to the army. As I had this experience of teaching at the university, I remembered at the time to look
  at universities here in Portugal. The University of Aveiro had just been founded, the University of
  Minho was also being established and I applied. I wrote letters to many places and one of which was
  to the University of Minho, to Aveiro and to other companies, some even with the prospect of returning
  to Africa, to Angola, in short, several companies that had activities in Angola and Mozambique, let
  alone If I didn't have to go back to Africa, I would if I got a job. It was very difficult at that time.




  I applied to the University of Minho without knowing who was at the university. Only later, when I got
  the answer, did I know who was in Braga. They were people I had known for many years and some had
  even been my teachers. I received a response from Professor Barbosa Romero.
  He was on the Installing Committee at the time, he was the one who responded to me saying "yes ma'am", that
  He accepted me, which in principle he accepted, to come to Braga and visit.


  ## A little city ##




  I had never been here before. Braga was a smaller city, a provincial city as they used to say. I walked from Largo do Paço,
  when I had to go there, I walked to D. Pedro V, for
  outside, then I continued on D. Pedro V until there at Enguardas. There was that mini-market
  there, a little market on the corner, then further on the city practically ended, there was nothing else, it
  was just dirt paths. Around that historic center the city quickly ended.


  Campo da Vinha, which is now called Praça Conde de Agrolongo, was entirely made of dirt, it was
  really a vineyard field, there were only those Misericórdia buildings, the GNR barracks and the rest was
  fields, land.




  I moved from Lisbon to Braga with my wife. We had nothing, we were in my parents' house on loan and I
  tried to make this happen as quickly as possible
  and so we were. My wife, at the time, was also hired here, for Chemistry, for the
  Science courses and we came to Braga. My wife always accompanied me. He came to work at the university
  for the Chemistry Department. My daughters grew up here in Braga, they studied here in schools.




  We were in England for three/four years studying, doing our PhD, between the end of 1976 and the
  beginning of 1980. So they went to school in England for a few years, the oldest one especially. The
  youngest attends the University of Minho, finishing her undergraduate degree this year.
  Informatics Engineering, has already completed the fifth year, is completing the last courses and the internship report.

 ## A life teaching ##




  I arrived here in Braga, for the first time, in June 1975. I disembarked at the railway station and walked to Largo do Paço
  looking for the university and the people who had written to me.
  At that time, I had an interview with professor Barbosa Romero and then there were more people here, on the Installing
  Committee, such as professor Carlos Loyd Braga, professor Barreiros Martins, professor Cheinho Pereira, who is
  currently rector. They were all here and I knew them because the
   Professor Loyd Braga had been my Physics teacher, Professor Cheinho Pereira, he was an assistant at the time, he was
  also my Physics teacher, he gave some practical Physics classes, Professor Romero was never my teacher, but he was
  my wife's Chemistry teacher, he is a Chemical Engineer and Professor Barreiros Martins, I knew him from Civil Engineering
  in Lourenço Marques because he became the director of the Faculty of Engineering, in Lourenço Marques, in short we had
  other friendly relationships there. So there were these people I knew, who knew me too.




  The fact that I discovered that there were people from the University of Lourenço Marques in Braga, at the University of
  Minho, was due to Professor Machado dos Santos. Before I wrote here looking for a job, I found it by pure chance, in
  Rossio, in Lisbon. I was walking around, seeing if I could find people I knew, I was looking for a job at the time, and I
  came face to face with Professor Machado dos Santos, who had come from England, had finished his PhD a few months
  ago and was passing through Lisbon, to legalize some documents at the Ministry of Education and returning to Braga.
  Professor Machado dos Santos had been my teacher of two subjects, Electronics and then Data Transmission, at the
  University of Lourenço Marques, in short, telecommunications subjects. He had been an assistant when I was a student
  and then went to England for his doctorate. Meanwhile, I finished the course and when I returned to Portugal, we met in
  Lisbon, and he was the one who said to me: - "Look, write to the University of Minho, Professor Romero is there,
  Professor Loyd Braga, all these people ." He was the one behind my coming to the University of Minho.




  I handed in a CV, discussed a little about what I had done in Lourenço Marques, they were all from there and knew the
  environment, so they hired me provisionally and then effectively as a casual assistant, from October 1975. I
  immediately started working here , from June, since I arrived. There was a lot of work, a university was being set up, which
  began
  formally installed in 1974.



  ## Facilities in Largo do Paço ##




  The university facilities were only in Largo do Paço, there was only Largo do Paço, there was nothing else. There were
  administrative services, the first things to be placed at the university, the headquarters of the Installing
  Committee, there wasn't even a rectory, it was the president of the Committee
  Installer plus some personalities from the Installation Committee. Then there were the units that came to form the Science
  and Engineering school, which were part of a single unit, called CETE, Exact Sciences and Technologies. Sciences and
  Engineering were together, these people I knew were in that unit and I joined there. Another person, who I haven't
  mentioned yet, is Professor Sérgio Machado dos Santos, who was the dean here before.

  Now going back to 1975, when I arrived here, Professor Machado dos Santos was one of the people
  who was at the University of Minho, was forming, let's say, an Informatics Center that later became the Department of
  Informatics. He was the first person in IT and I became the second, because he finally hired me. Machado dos Santos was
  the Systems and IT professor and I was his assistant. At the time, with the university being set up, there was a lot
  to do, an amount of work that had nothing to do with courses or classes, it was the installation of laboratories, equipment,
  acquisition and competition of material, organizational issues of the university itself. , regulations and operating modes. I
  was involved in all of this, doing these tasks. I followed the construction of the university from the beginning.




  That same year, in 1975, classes began for the first time at the university, it was the first year
  that there were classes in Largo do Paço. The classrooms that existed were in the space where they are currently
  the heritage services, and where the personnel service is located, in Largo do Paço. If you look at Largo do Paço from the
  front, on the right side there is a door that gives access to the personnel service, the treasury and assets, now
  everything is closed off, but in the past, it was an open space and there were two or three office rooms. classes, very
  good by the way. Another classroom was the medieval hall, in Largo do
   Paço, where the ceremonies now take place. The hall was divided in half with a corridor to give way to the Public Library,
  and on the north side was a room and on the south side was another classroom.
  There were two classes running there at the same time. Professor Barreiros Martins giving Technical Drawing on one side,
  and me giving a practical IT class on the other, trying to speak louder than Professor Barreiros Martins and everything
  echoing in that room. It was then that the Systems and IT Course classes began.




  Meanwhile, the university acquired more buildings. One of the first buildings he acquired was D. Pedro V, where he then
  had the Academic Association. The D. Pedro V building was where the classes went, they stopped being in Largo do
  Paço and moved there, there were some amphitheaters there, I don't know if they still exist, but we users left Largo do Paço
  and went to D. Pedro V.



  In D. Pedro V there was almost everything, there were the classrooms downstairs, on the two floors above were the
  teachers' offices, because it was a residential building, therefore, the apartments are on the first floor, left - right,
  with rooms, kitchens, bathrooms, living rooms, etc.



  My first office was in a kitchen in that building, then on the top floor there was a residence, precisely to welcome
  people who came to Braga for the first time and had nowhere to be. It was a residence where there were some rooms
  with beds, where people stayed, slept and so on. I stayed at the residence for a few weeks until I found a house,
  then I found a house and left, but this was the first building where I was installed. I slept, went down one floor and was in the
  office, went down two floors and was in classes.




  That was fun practically every day, well, people were in their offices, which were those rooms in those apartments.
  Usually the younger ones, like me and other colleagues of mine, such as Guimarães Rodrigues, president of the School
  of Engineering at the time, joined that year, a few months after me, and we shared the interior office.




  That was how it was, the younger ones, the assistants, went to the worst offices and as new ones arrived they took up the
  worst places and we, the older teachers, kept moving. For example, going from an interior cabinet to the kitchen was an
  improvement, because in the kitchen we had
Machine Translated by Google
 windows, we had light. I remember episodes, for example, when I came from my PhD in 1980, they were
 still at D.PedroV, it was Professor Machado dos Santos, the only person with a PhD in that Informatics
 Center, there were already several assistants when I came from my PhD , and I was the second
 doctorate in the department to come into effect in 80. Professor Machado dos Santos had other things to
 do at the university, for example, he was president of the Scientific Council, in fact it was already at
 the time when I came from the doctorate , so that, as soon as he found me here, he immediately
 became director, coordinator of the Information Technology Department, in 1980, and then I moved up in
 the office, it was at that time that I moved to the kitchen. I was coordinator of the IT Center and finally
 received people, hired assistants, did interviews in the kitchen and to avoid looking too bad, I had to
 order the university's workshops to make me a lid imitating an electronics laboratory bench, to put
 over the top. from the dishwasher, so as not to make a bad impression on the people he was receiving.
 Anyway, that's how I started to disguise the kitchen.


  Meanwhile, the Installation Committee and the rectory acquired these lands where Gualtar is located, I
  believe they belonged to the Ministry of the Army, it was a future expansion of the barracks or the shooting rang
  There was a negotiation that I didn't follow, that was the responsibility of the Installing Committee, they manage
  these lands. Then projects began to appear and buildings were discussed. The buildings began to be
  constructed and in 1985/86, we moved to Gualtar.


  The courses were naturally increasing, with students increasingly demanding the facilities. The first
  building to be built was the CPI, Pedagogical Complex I, followed by those around it, the Science and IT
  Building. There was only that, the rest was all land. Then CPII followed and, finally, little by little over
  these years they were built and the university increased, both in the number of students and teachers.



  Around the first pavilions everything was completely empty, because we were coming from the city we said
  - "Para Gualtar, para Gualtar" - it was like someone going there to Póvoa de Lanhoso, but this
  also quickly developed. In fact, the highway that went to Bom Jesus already existed, and it was a
  short walk away, so coming to Gualtar wasn't that difficult, but there weren't the houses that there are now.


  ## The first classrooms ##




  That same year, in 1975, classes began for the first time at the university, it was the first year
  that there were classes in Largo do Paço. The classrooms that existed were in the space where they are currentl

  installed. I slept, went down one floor and was in the office, went down two floors and was in classes.




  That was fun practically every day, well, people were in their offices, which were those rooms in those
  apartments. Usually the younger ones, like me and other colleagues of mine, such as Guimarães Rodrigues,
  president of the School of Engineering at the time, joined that year, a few months after me, and we shared
  the interior office.


 That was how it was, the younger ones, the assistants, went to the worst offices and as new ones arrived
 they took up the worst places and we, the older teachers, kept moving. For example, going from an interior
 cabinet to the kitchen was an improvement, because in the kitchen we had windows, we had light. I remember
 episodes, for example, when I came from my PhD in 1980, they were still at D.PedroV, it was Professor
 Machado dos Santos, the only person with a PhD in that Informatics Center, there were already several
 assistants when I came from my PhD , and I was the second doctorate in the department to come into
 effect in 80. Professor Machado dos Santos had other things to do at the university, for example, he was
 president of the Scientific Council, in fact it was already at the time when I came from the doctorate , so
 that, as soon as he found me here, he immediately became director, coordinator of the Information
 Technology Department, in 1980, and then I moved up in the office, it was at that time that I moved to the
 kitchen. I was coordinator of the IT Center and finally received people, hired assistants, did interviews in
 the kitchen and to avoid looking too bad, I had to order the university's workshops to make me a lid imitating
 an electronics laboratory bench, to put over the top. from the dishwasher, so as not to make a bad
 impression on the people he was receiving. Anyway, that's how I started to disguise the kitchen.

  ## Initial courses ##




  All existing courses operated at D.Pedro V. In the first and second year there were few courses
  and few students, everyone could fit there. There were Engineering courses, which all had a common core,
  therefore, regardless of specialties, in the first years everyone was in practically the same classes. There were a dozen in IT,
  as I said, there were a dozen, then there were another dozen other specialties and there were thirty students in total, thirty
  something. Then I suppose there was the Science Teacher Training course, Portuguese teachers, Mathematics teachers,
  Natural Sciences or Natural Sciences teachers and they all fit in that building. All the students at the university, at that
  time, could fit in those rooms, there were two amphitheaters, then there was one more and there were those practical
  rooms around it. Then they started to grow, there were a dozen rooms on the ground floor, in D. Pedro V and practically
  everyone could fit there.




  Of those courses that I know, I think the university prepares students very well. The University of Minho has good
  recognition abroad, at least in the field of Engineering
  Computer Systems and it can be seen objectively, when the course was evaluated several times by the Order of Engineers,
  or by the Ministry of Education, it always had a good evaluation, and was always one of the first courses in the country in
  that field. Then you can see from the demand for courses that they are always full, we have always had many students
  and this is a good measure of the success of the training that takes place in this area.




  ## The students ##




  The first year, I don't remember well, but the first year there were still a lot, about twelve students, around
  from that. The second year of operation there were even fewer and then from then on the number of students began to grow.
  In the first year there were twelve or thirteen and in the second year there were six or seven and then the
  From then on there started to be twenty, thirty were always increasing.

  The work environment was very good because there were few people, we all knew each other very well, we were all dealing
  , with the same type of problems regardless of where we were, in terms of whether it was IT, whether it was Production
  Engineering, whether it was another Engineering. any, or if it was a Science course. We all lived with the same concerns, we
  all knew each other. I went to Largo do Paço, where the administrative services were, we went in there and we knew
  everyone. Everyone knew each other very well, it was practically a family atmosphere.




  ## Memories ##




  The most significant thing is what has always been the case when there is progress at the university, both in ter
  of people and spaces, the development of the university was always planned, naturally, there were
  setbacks in the execution of that planning but it was overcome. The people who were in
  The university management overcame them, but things always went to their limits. When we were in
  some facilities they were filled to the limit and even when we were bursting at the seams, in terms of
  not having space for students and teachers, after a month the facilities were ready and we came here.
  We lived more comfortably for a year, but when they said growth was fast, after a year or two
  everything was coming apart at the seams. What I remember about life here is an experience always
  bursting at the seams,
  during all these years, during the twenty years, perhaps. It is still noticeable today, especially when we
  are witnessing the creation of timetables for courses and there are no rooms, or new courses are
  already being programmed with yet another pedagogical complex but which is not completely ready
  or will be . And there are doubts whether it will be ready. The resources at this university have always been
  well used there was never anything wasted.


  ## Go to Mozambique sailing ##



  I've never been to Mozambique since I came back from there. I've had several opportunities,
  one of which was recently, until last year, on a master's degree in Computer Systems, which the
  Engineering school is offering in Mozambique, but I didn't want to go there. I have too many good and, I
  think, innocent memories of Mozambique to revisit in another situation.


  Some friends stayed in Mozambique for a few years, but after a while they returned, came here and
  many went to other places. I have many colleagues who left Mozambique and went to South Africa,
  others to Canada, others to the strangest places, some to Saudi Arabia, others to Brazil and others
  came here. Almost all, except a small number, left elsewhere. There it is, many because their roots
  weren't there and any place in the world that wasn't there was the same.



  Interestingly, I have a plan to go back there              , a bit risky, which is on a sailing boat. Mine
Machine Translated by Google
  My wife calls me crazy, everyone calls me but I have a project, I would like to go back there but
  under those conditions. One of my dreams is to take a trip to Mozambique. I keep a little book with
  notes about what I want to do at these times and I point out: "Remember to do this, get this map,
  get this biography" - to read and study routes.


  Look, I'm 52 years old, since I started this career and stayed here, I have six or seven years ahead
  of me before I reach the time of my retirement, so I have six or seven years from now until then to
  think about it. I have plans to do things after I stop teaching at the university. In terms of my career
  at the university, I am a full professor and, therefore, I have reached the end of my career, although
  I have a lot to do and want to do a lot here. I've only been a full professor for a year and a half,
  and I finally have this plan to go on an adventure like this. It may or may not happen, but I hope so.



  ## Health and coexistence ##




  My concerns in general are to take care of the family's health, that people are healthy. Secondly, my
  concern, in family terms, is that my daughters achieve what they want to do. Apparently they chose
  the courses they are taking. One just likes animals, is studying to be a veterinarian, only sees dogs
  and cats and things like that, and the other, anyway, is in IT. My ambition is that they achieve what
  they want to do, regardless of what it is, that they are satisfied.



  On a professional level, one of my constant ambitions is to get rid of papers, although I try to be
  relatively organized administratively in terms of papers, but I hate papers, administrations,
  meetings, minutes, regulations, competitions and formalism. My ambition is to free myself from
  these tasks as much as possible, because I really like practical work, whenever I can I escape to
  the laboratory, put the screwdriver in my pocket and go do things there, work on my terminal
  computer or do projects like that. Therefore, one of my ambitions, at this moment, was to be
  able to be in more permanent contact with people and students.


  ## "Everyday life is full of nothings" ##




  Everyday life is full of nothings. I can say that sometimes, as happens to a lot of people, I get to the
  end of the day and think: - "I'm tired, I walked from there to here, but what did I do?" I didn't do
  anything special, the system kept working. I often say that I go to the office or am called there to
  move a piece of paper from one place to another and then I leave and I am satisfied because I
  completed a task. And it's things like that.


  ## The fascination with the sea ##




  In my free time I like to read, especially adventure books or nautical books. I really like without
  Going on a boat, I like sailing on the sea,     , engines. It's a bit risky, it depends on what the
  but there are precautions that a person can take. There is always a risk in what you do and
Machine Translated by Google
 In this activity there is a risk that can be minimized if the person prepares properly.



  The sea is fantastic. Literally when I came to Portugal, all these years, I stopped sailing because I had no possibilities,
  here in Braga there is no sea nearby. It was only very recently, three or four years ago, that I resumed this, took the
  cards again, in Viana do Castelo. Now I have a boat
  and I've already walked with him on the coast, in the south of Galicia.




  Last year I went to the Algarve on the boat and I have it in the Algarve navy. I went with my wife and my youngest daughter.
  They have some fear, but my youngest daughter, who is 24 years old and very
  adventurous, she really likes new experiences, she likes adventures, she gets along well with everyone, she is very
  sociable, she took this with great enthusiasm. My wife went there to try it. The trip to the Algarve was good, it was done
  over several days, it was a trip. We left Leixões, on the 5th of August last year, after Leixões we went to Figueira da
  Foz, a direct route, in Figueira we entered the Mondego on a four-day navy. The weather was bad, the bar was closed
  to go out, we were there with friends. After Figueira da Foz another trip to Peniche we stayed there for a few days, after
  Peniche we passed Cabo Ráso and Cabo da Roca and then went to Lisbon, Cascais,

  Belém. In Lisbon, as my mother is there, we anchored there for a few days, we spent the month of August, the whole month. Each
  day we made one of these crossings, then in Figueira da Foz we stayed four days, in Peniche we stayed two, in Lisbon we
  stayed a week, then we went to Mil Fontes, we spent two or three days sleeping on the boat, cooking, the boat has kitchen has bed
                                                                                                                 ,
  has everything. After Mil Fontes I went to the Algarve, crossing Cabo de São Vicente, the tip of Sagres and Lagos.
  @corpus\danielle_entrevista.md # Memories of the University of Minho: Interview with Deborah Perrota de Andrade




  Interview carried out by Danielle Pinto Assis, on 04/03/2024 with the former student of the Doctoral and
  Post-doctoral courses at the University of Minho, Deborah Perrota de Andrade. Its about
  an activity that is part of the Data Analysis and Visualization discipline for the Digital Humanities course, celebrating
  50 years of UM. The main objective of this conclusion work is to address everything that
  is related to the theme of 50 years of the University of Minho. So, we will carry out a series of interviews with people
  who have had or have some type of experience at university and with this information material will be generated
  and we will work with this discipline, in order to carry out
  the recording, extraction, processing, analysis and visualization of lexical and linguistic data, through the use of
  natural language. I thank you for your time and also for the fact that in this work we can carry out a qualitative and
  quantitative analysis of all this material.



  ## Personal life


  My name is Débora Perrotta de Andrade. I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. I am a software engineer and have a
  PhD. Currently, I work with software quality, so I work together with teams, providing support for the quality of the
  software developed and I also have some software project management functions. I work at Bosch, in Braga.

  This year, I've been in Portugal for 15 years, it's been a long time. I chose to live here, mainly for the tranquility and quality
  of life. So much so that I've been here for a long time and have no plans to return to Brazil. I think what is gained here is
  the level of quality of life and raising children, it is not
  comparable to what I would have in Brazil.



  ## Experience at the University of Minho



  ### What is your involvement with the University of Minho?
Machine Translated by Google



  Well, I had two stages in the movement. My PhD was done with the University of Porto in
  partnership with the University of Minho and the University of Lisbon and in the meantime
  after finishing my PhD, I also had a post-doctoral project from the University of Minho, in
  partnership with Bosch. This was back in 2016, so I have had contact with the University,
  especially on the Guimarães campus, for a long time.


  ### What did you study?

  Exactly my doctorate was in manufacturing. So, advanced manufacturing techniques and product
  development and my PhD was focused on that, but on the leadership aspect to be able to promote
  these types of topics. And then the post-doctoral project was in the management of industrialization
  projects, which are basically industrialization, which is the bridge between product development
  and production.


  ### How long did you stay at the University of Minho?

  From the beginning... so the PhD was in 2010 and I stayed in contact there either in one way or
  another until 2017, the end of 2017 for 7 years, considering all the passages.


  ### Why did you choose this University precisely?

  I think I see, like here in Portugal, three or four main universities that I would really like to study
  even when I came here too. When I came here it was to do a master's degree. And the University
  of Minho for me represented quality of teaching and renown. So, I think it was a bit because of
  that and combined with the fact that I wanted to avoid the big capital. This also made the Minho
  campus suitable for my background, which is engineering. So Guimarães campus. For me, it
  was like an easy Fit on my side.


  ### What memories do you have about the university during this long period that you spent
  there?

  For me, it's all about people. So I felt very welcomed at the University of Minho.
  I felt that people are there to help you, feeling that if you have any questions, even if the person
  doesn't know how to help you, they will find someone who knows how to help. I don't know... I
  really felt very welcomed, even so, I felt like I was in a strange country at a strange university,
  with strange people and yet I didn't have any difficulty interacting with people. So for me,
  the University of Minho also represented a bit of this really natural hospitality because people from
  the North have it too, I also observe that. People are very helpful, very friendly and you have to
  understand that they are not doing what it is their obligation to do. It's just because they simply
  want to help and want you to feel good and ready.



  ### And besides studying, what else did you do at university? Did you participate in any groups,
  any projects, any communities? Did you participate in internal university events?

  During the PhD, I participated in what happened around the PhD and any type of session that
  had on the subject of my thesis or of course traveling to present the article at conferences,
  I made a point of being physically present precisely to participate in what was happening. So, for
Machine Translated by Google
  For example, at UM I saw things that I didn't see in Porto or Lisbon, which is the department I was in
  inserted. I did some activities there to promote people's interaction. And then imagine... there was
  Magusto, in November. So, they found kilos and kilos of chestnuts there and we went to the hallway with
  those warm chestnuts to eat, interact, socialize. And that was one of the things I liked most about it. That is
  the idea was no, no you are not in your study square. Imagine... a PhD is a very lonely thing in that
  sense. You have your thesis, no one else has to bother there. But, I was in a room with people working on
  completely different things and we always found a way to have lunch together. The canteen itself

  The university is also popular. Depending on the time of year and what important date was happening at
  that time, the canteen adapted it too. In that sense, I always tried to participate in things. I think the
  University of Minho is very good at this. It even attacks people
  socialize and interact and that's it, it's part of the issue of welcoming people. I think it makes all the
  difference for those who come from abroad, especially for those who come from abroad and we need
  to adapt. Get to know the places, get to know the people, the customs.


  ### There is a question here that you enjoyed the experience of studying at the University of Minho. I think
  that maybe answered.

  Now yes, I really liked it.


  ### If you want to highlight something that you haven't said, but besides the issue of welcoming
  socialization, I don't know, maybe, if you want to complete something, but I felt like it's already been
  answered, we'll say it right and what else do you did you like it? If you want to join you can join too.

  I think it's also a two-way street. Precisely because I felt very welcomed. I think
  that I was also able to give a lot of myself and I was also able to help other people a lot, be it a simple
  thing, how do I use this article manager, or more technical things that were related to my
  background too. I think this is a two-way, a two-way, something like that and that's it. In our popular
  version, this is what it says and I think that also another thing that in my doctorate, of course I had contact
  with many professors at UM and this close contact with them, which remained afterwards and ended up
  remaining in a certain way, also made my In this case, my doctoral advisor, he gave me the news that
  there UM had a lot of partnerships with
  Bosch and maybe I saw something that I could contribute and I ended up in a project that involved a
  professor who was my PhD professor. So... I also think that kind of the connections we make. This
  socialization, this connection made everything a lot easier because in the meantime I was again when
  I went back to do my doctorate options. I was once again surrounded by the people I already knew and if I
  didn't know the people I knew, they would let me know the others and everything was fine. I was at home
  again, so for me a lot of the benefit I got from that period I had there and I miss it, I confess that I miss
  that period. I really wanted to leave the gym and go to work, but if I were to stay in the gym, without a
  doubt I would want to stay there. I don't think what I had there, I didn't have any other.




  ### Which discipline did you like most, that you identified as a favorite or that
  added you?

  It is difficult. Well, in my PhD I had many technical subjects. Because the doctorate itself was very
  technical, but there were some disciplines that I would say were transversal and could be applicable.
  In anything you will do in your life, for example, I had a leadership role that was very good. And I
  had one that, incredibly, is usually what people don't like, but
  I really like it and I still work with it today, which is processes. So... imagine the Restart goals part and how
  to apply it. What is the benefit of one What is the benefit of the other? What is the cons of a
Machine Translated by Google
  controller? I loved this subject and I happened to be part of the teaching staff of this subject, a teacher who I mentioned
  was my PhD teacher and then came to work with me again. It can't give torment, was that it, or is it once again, is that it?
  They are the contacts.




  ## Highlights



  ### Would you highlight any important and unforgettable situation or fact, something that really stood out during this
  entire period you experienced at university? It may be related to your course.


  The diversity of people is by chance. I just remembered, while I was in postdoc.
  Well, more recently there was an inauguration of a 3D printing laboratory and 3D printing in composites. Anyway... polymers
  in general like metal and there were illustrious people present there, from the Portuguese government and I thought I was very
  important there, very privileged to be able to be there at that moment. And since it was open like that, nowadays you can't just
  get there and enter the laboratory, but that day, as I was there on the opening day, I could go in and I could see things happen.
  So, for me, this was a very big milestone for the privilege of being there, and for the notoriety that the University of
  Minho also gained even more. And it made a difference in that sense to have those illustrious presences there in the place
  where I was there studying types of sneakers, you know without being formal or anything, but being able to participate in
  that, being able to participate in such a huge milestone not only for the University of Minho but, for Guimarães to the North of
  Portugal, you know, for me it was really a privilege and it was what really impacted me.




  ### What were the main challenges and difficulties you faced during your time at university?



  I don't recommend the doctoral thesis to anyone because it alone is very difficult. It's almost a trauma, I don't recommend
  it unless the person really has a lot of vocation ready. It's not for everyone and it's very difficult to maintain motivation,
  but there you go, I think having that support also helps a lot because you've been there for four years. It takes three years to
  write the thesis and the first year is just subjects. Then you have three more years to write, it seems like a long time, but it's not
  much at all. There are so many comings and goings that if you don't have good support, even from the doctorate faculty
  itself, from your supervisor, and I had excellent support,


  from the advisor you really don't move forward and it's not easy. Therefore, the thesis itself, the doctorate itself, was a
  difficulty, it was a great difficulty, but not caused by the University. In fact, the university helped me overcome this in the best
  way possible. In the post-doctorate it was much smoother. It is no longer a burden on the thesis. To spend work with a more
  practical approach because the work that was developed there was applied at Bosch in people's daily lives, here at Bosch
  today it also has its appeal. For me it was very important... to see things in practice at a challenging level. That's it, the PhD
  was a big challenge, but that's it, the PhD. I don't think I know anyone who said it. Oh yes. It was calm, there was no
  point as there wasn't much involved.




  ### I think you've already commented on a question like this, but about friends. Did you make friends at university? Do you
  still have contact with people today, have you created a community?


  Within the University, I formed my group as a doctorate. My group from that year, from the doctorate of that course,
  by chance, we stayed together for a long time, I confess that joking, joking, it's been almost 10 years since I finished
  my doctorate. Therefore, life itself also deals with the matter. But there are people that I still maintain some contact with, I
  won't say super close, but in the meantime with the group that shared the laboratory with me I'm there when I say
Machine Translated by Google
 laboratory is not a testing laboratory, experiments as they called the rooms where people were doing their things.
 So imagine me. And in the same room there are 6 to 8 people, each with their own project, whether it's a PhD or a
 Master's or a post-Doctorate, it doesn't matter.
  They were all there and we were there every day, we were at the university every day and we went
  have lunch every day together and with these people from this group and I'm talking about, they're not just Portuguese,
  we have Mexicans. There was a Venezuelan girl, there was also another Brazilian boy ready there, people of various
  nationalities and with this group I keep in touch to this day and we still mark one day a year on the day of the
  Afonsina fair, she is in Guimarães. Because Guimarães was where we met to be together. Therefore, it is a group that
  was really another gift from UM to me, great for life, friends are really very happy and very difficult. Many people are in
  Portugal or have also returned to their countries, some have already returned and then we can't find the Brazilians,
  they returned to Brazil, but have already returned here, so usually at this fair. He is present, there is another girl who also
  did a Brazilian doctorate, she returned to Brazil, but in the meantime she came

  work in Lisbon, so she came to Guimarães at the Afonsina fair to be with us and she also has a little daughter, that is,
  the generations pass by. She already has a son, so that's how it is and we have two Portuguese women who continue to
  live here in the north, they are also always present at the Afonsina fair and
  So imagine, I stopped being with them daily in 2000 at the end of 2017. And since then, apart from the pandemic,
  every year we meet at the Afonsina fair. So, this is how we became friends for life, we have friends for life, for sure.




  ### You have already spoken about the University, several times you highlighted points such as the University's reception
  and people's motivation for education. Is there another Positive Point Any other point you would like to highlight
  considering the time you attended?

  I don't know if I missed anything in terms of positive points, but I also didn't talk about anything negative,
  That's why everything I've said so far about UM has been positive and in fact it was and there's a question there, in relation
  to what you would propose to improve, which I tried to improve considering the time I attended, right. I don't
  know, I don't know what it's like today. But I noticed at that time that it could improve for me, but I think it's not
  exclusive to the University of Minho, I think it's a matter of public bodies in general, there were a lot of things there that
  were very bureaucratic,
  so sometimes things that in my head, it's not enough to say that I could improve that sense or not, but in any case things
  that to me seemed simple to resolve had to go through a very lengthy, complex process that required the signature of
  many people ready,
  You already have bureaucracy in the system. I think it's something that I hope nowadays has improved a little. If
  it hasn't improved, it's a shame, but it's the negative point that I've highlighted, it's this issue of bureaucracy involved, but
  I say that it's not exclusive to UM because I was also
  at the University of Porto and it was the same and I had it at the University of Lisbon and it was the same, so it's a question eve
  Maybe the processes that are established for public bodies require more global measures in this regard, or the University
  of Minho alone, cannot make it much easier. I don't have anything else, I also observe that a bit of bureaucracy and even
  perhaps very traditional methods, but maybe that's also why it's because it's protocols that are followed and
  that are part of a standard at exactly the same time and nobody picked up on that to stop renew to remake to improve.
  So, I understand that it is a much bigger machine than just the UM. There's nothing else to point out in general.




  ## Professional Relevance



  ### How do you evaluate the relevance of your period at university considering your personal life and professional life
  as a final assessment?



  I think it was extremely relevant as you can see were. And many years involved and not
Machine Translated by Google
  It ended because imagine me, but it's there because of the contacts. While I was at Bosch, I supervised students from the
  University of Minho on their Master's theses. I am now working with an intern who is reporting directly to me from a course
  at the University of Minho. So the cycle doesn't end. So you know, for me, relevance. It is in this sense because I know
  people and sometimes I can even be a facilitator for some matters at UM itself, I can suggest imagining any doubt that my
  intern has within UM, I can try to help and this notion

  that even though I've been away for a while now, I have this notion that I can always
  go back to contact someone and everything is fine and I have it. I'm sure they will help me if they can, so for me the
  relevance was very high in this sense. I think I created a network there and the friends I made are also a bond, I think I left
  the University of Minho, but the University of Minho didn't leave me.




  ### Comment


  I think it's a bit like that, UM didn't come from you. Thank you very much for your participation.

  Okay, so the teacher doesn't mind if I record the audio, does she?

  No, no, no.


  So, I wanted to start by asking about its origin, where it comes from and why it then has
  coming to the University of Minho, and the professor is from Porto, studied in Porto.




  ## Family context


  Exactly. Thank you for this conversation that Maurício organized, and I will try to respond to you to give you an idea of my
  journey.
  I'm from the district of Coimbra, municipality of Cantanhede, and like many people, my family migrated to Porto when I
  was 8 years old, so I did half of primary school in the village and the other half
  in Port. Afterwards, I did my studies there. The reason my family left the village for Porto was so that my parents could
  pay for all their children's studies. There are four of us and there was no state secondary education in our municipality, so
  it would be a private school for my brother, and there was no secondary education for girls in the municipality. So, my
  sisters came to Porto for boarding school, and then when the idea of having four children outside the home loomed, my
  mother decided to move house and came to Porto, and so we could all go and study in official education and I ended up
  doing higher education also in Porto.



  My older sister wanted to do Physical Education, that was what the course was called at the time, and there was only a
  degree in Lisbon, so, after the whole family came to Porto to meet my sisters, my older sister old woman went to Lisbon; My
  brother stayed in Porto, and my sister Margarida also studied History in Porto. And when I was a little girl I consciously
  chose languages, when I was 12 years old. I thought that what I wanted was to speak the languages of the other people I
  would meet, and perhaps also because I really liked the French teachers or the atmosphere at the French Institute,
  because I had classes at the French Institute, in addition of high school classes.

  Then, when I was able to study English in what corresponds to my seventh year, the choice took a different direction and I
  became more interested in English and German, so I continued to study French at the French Institute, in high school until
  the 5th year or so. current ninth, but then I got French at the French Institute. I studied German, continued to study English,
  and in the meantime, I would be a candidate to go to Lisbon
Machine Translated by Google
  or to Coimbra, because there were no Germanic Colleges in Porto when I chose Germanic Colleges, in 1970 - 70-71, 71-72,
  then 72-73 when I went to university, therefore, in 1970 there were no Germanic Colleges in Porto -, and I was lucky that at
  that time the Minister of Education Veiga Simão had managed to open up an opening to increase academic training at
  universities. Then it opened in Letras do Porto where there were Philosophy, Geography, Romance and History, also
  Germanic. So, I was once a person who didn't need to go to boarding school or move to another city to go to University.
  This was a lot, I think, especially for my parents, because financially it is always very complicated.




  I come from a family where my mother was a primary school teacher and my father was a merchant and farmer, he had
  land. People within our economic profile, who arrived at the University, were
  2% of the population. My mother had a secondary education, my father only had primary education, my sister was already at
  university when I went... but I was always aware, from an early age, that even though it was state education I was
  privileged, because very few people could reach that level, and, in fact, from my primary school class, from my class, no
  one went to university, and then, from the High School, I still have friends today, eight people - it was a female
  High School -, who went through the whole high school course with me, and the university. So, we chose the same
  specialization, the same section - that's what it was called -, and then we went to Germanicas and took the course. We enrolled
  in the Germanic Philology course, because in the past the studies were philological, therefore the study of language,
  literature and culture, in 1972.



  Therefore, I followed this path: my mother's school, where my mother was a teacher; the Porto school on Rua do Bonjardim,
  a really proletarian school, I must have been one of the few girls at school who had three or four meals a day, the others
  ate soup that they took to school, from the legion.
  It was an area with many islands, if you know the population of Porto, the Islands are the proletarian neighborhoods, which
  were very densely populated, that is to say, there was one family per room. And I had many
  of these little friends for whom university was a name they knew how to spell, it wasn't reality at all.



  Therefore, from primary school I didn't have any friends who went to university, and from high school I still have some friends
  who followed this path, some of them went on to work in the social world, in business, in Social Security, and six of them, or
  five of them , in secondary education. And I, of these eight people, who we still meet today, was the only one who went to
  higher education, and I was the last one to retire. The others had all retired and were always asking me “When will you
  be able to come and have lunch with us without always running around?”, and that has now happened, and that’s it, it’s
  another stage in my life.



  Therefore, the choice to opt for languages was very early, it was a choice because yes and not because no. It wasn't that
  situation where you don't know mathematics, you go to letters... by chance at that time, I had a lot of failures in mathematics,
  but it was a situation that lasted two years, then, at the time
  I had to choose letters or science, my teachers all thought I was going to science,
  because I scored 17 in mathematics in the exam, but, in fact, it was just because I had discovered mathematics
  and that was great fun. But, in fact, that was not my interest. My interest was in the humanities. That was interesting
  because it made me choose my career without any prejudice that I wasn't capable of doing something else if I wanted,
  and that's really good, that we can choose instead of being “you have to do this because other things are
  impossible” or, “I can choose anything, as long as it’s black” like in Ford cars. In this case, it wasn't like that. I think I've
  already given you the answer to that question, about my origins.



  As for his choice, he chose the University of Minho, having completed his degree in Porto.

  ## Education at the time of April 25th


  This is a story that is, let's say, paradigmatic of a time. We spoke a while ago about Minister Veiga Simão, with the opening
  and creation of new courses in Porto. So this was still during the
Machine Translated by Google
 Marcelista spring, let's say, because the year I took my secondary exams - because it was primary, secondary and
 complementary - therefore, when I took your ninth exams, it was the year in which Salazar fell from his chair, then there
 was another person to take over the government, which was Marcelo Caetano,
 and with that came an expectation that tension and repression could be alleviated a little, and if these things were not
 very visible, what was visible was that in education there was a minister, who was Veiga Simão, who He was a person who
 was able to bring a certain modernity to a system that was very ankylosed. And then new courses opened, as soon
 as I attended in 72, after
 we will talk about it.

   Was it five years at the time?


   It was five years, and in the past there were 5-year degrees, and degrees with a thesis. Normally, people who completed
  a degree with a thesis took another year to complete their thesis, and this involved costs, because people who
  completed the course wanted to go to work and if, after five years - imagine, for example, my sister who was in Lisbon
  studying, she soon started teaching, to make it less burdensome for her family - but, in any case, if instead of five, it
  was six years, it was a much greater cost, and then one of the things that happened on the 25th of April they put an
  end to degrees with thesis. Therefore, they continued with 5 years, but, at the end of 5 years, you had a bachelor's
  degree, and there was no other diploma – after all, this would already be a master's degree, let's say, but at that time
  there were no shows in Portugal .



  Therefore, I chose this course, I chose Germanics, I attended this course, and at the same time, in 76/77 - I now don't
  remember very well who the Minister of Education was at that time, it was no longer Minister Vítor Alves, because These
  governments were relatively brief, a year or so - I remember that the director of the Faculty of Arts of Porto called together
  the students of the faculty - we were not
  so many, it was practically the Germanic course plus a few appendices, because Germanic in those
  Three years after it was in operation, there were around 300 of us, and the other courses, all together, must have been less
  than 100, so Germanics was a very large course.

  ### Incentives to study languages

  There were no computers yet, so there was no incentive to study English. I think it was the Beatles, who made the English
  language very attractive. I had a very diverse upbringing, because we had television, as everything was subtitled,
  we listened to several languages, and we had Spanish films, with Marisol and Joselito, we had Italian films, also with
  children - therefore, the films that I remember seeing when I was 13/14 years old - and then we also had French cinema,
  and the cartoons, Tom and Jerry and Felix the Cat were in English, but there were other languages, and then when the
  languages are accompanied with songs, they become very appealing. And I then had a lot of access to French, French
  songs, a little bit of French cinema, but then we also had Spanish and Italian. Therefore, English was just one
  more,

  but we cannot put Beatlemania aside at this point, because at the present time the cultural bodies of different countries
  have withdrawn considerably from their proselytization and dissemination. For example, going to the French Institute
  was going to take French classes, but it was being in a place sponsored by the French government where the rules were
  the same, respected the country, but were a little different. I, for example, could read magazines that I couldn't
  easily find abroad or didn't even have the money to buy, and they were in the French Institute's library for us to see. At
  the British Institute, it was also
  an institution very rooted in Portuguese culture, but it gave us access to another world, and these were small islands of
  thought that diverged from the established one. Without having the critical equipment to identify him, I think he felt like he
  was going to another country when he entered the French Institute.

  ## Creation of new universities and professional status of teachers

  Now, what happened was that, to answer your question, in 76/77, the director of the Faculty of
  Letras called us to tell us that our position as future teaching teachers was somewhat threatened, because the
  ministry was creating new universities that would train teachers
Machine Translated by Google
 who already came out with an internship, were already professionalized, and we came out with a 5-year degree, then
 we would apply for teaching, we would teach and then we would apply for an in-service internship, and internships
 only opened from time to time. Now, this was very different from the person already becoming a permanent employee,
 at a school, because they had completed an internship and were able to compete. I found out about this threat, let's
 say, that hung over me, when I finished my course. I finished the course in 77 and then won a scholarship from the
 British Council and went to England. After finishing the scholarship, I stayed there to work as an au pair, and in the
 meantime, it was October 77, and my family, apparently, in Portugal, was not
 I was very happy that I had spent 5 years studying a university course to be a maid. And then, I started receiving
 phone calls “Oh, daddy is not in good health, you are so far away...”, and that was it. That game of feeling guilty for
 being away from my father and my family, what if something happened, started, and I came to Portugal. So, I competed
 in mini-competitions and stayed at a school in Porto. Mini-contests, do you know what they are? There are competitions
 that are open within the school itself for vacancies that have not been filled nationally. So, schools had, for example,
 a schedule of 5 hours, or 10 hours, the Ministry wasn't going to place a person in those circumstances, and then
 the people who would be there, who had years of University, or had the seventh year of Graduated from high school, or
 had experience, there were series, and the best qualified was called to take that place. And then, in January 78, I was
 placed at a school close to my house, there was an 8 pm schedule. During the first period, those children had not
 had those Portuguese and English classes that I was teaching. And so, during the time I was at this school, I applied
 for everything, then I had to apply for secondary education or other jobs that came my way. And at that time, the
 University of Minho, exactly the one that was going to take jobs away from teachers who would leave classical
 schools, was recruiting, and someone in my family saw the ad and gave me the newspaper clipping “Look, the
 University of Minho Minho is asking for assistants for the English department or for the English pedagogical area”, and I
 then wrote a typed letter



  - I was also learning to type on a typewriter - and I sent it here and was called for an interview. So, I went, I passed this interview,
  we were four candidates - or, I mean, I don't know if we were more candidates, but four people were selected, three ladies and one
  gentleman -, and then, in September, I was placed on internship. We were at a time when, imagine, between Porto and Amarante, until
  then, there was practically no secondary education, because when I was a girl, I had classmates who came from Amarante, by train,
  from Caíde, from Marco de Canaveses, to the Liceu, to Porto. A school was created in the eastern part, which was the Liceu
  Rainha Santa, and this school was filled with this population. Now, imagine how many schools there are between Campanhã station, say,
  and Amarante, dozens. This means that the high school where I was and the other school that was created next door, Pires de Lima, of
  those four complexes, two are now at the service of the PSP because there are no children to fill those places, because before
  there were many boys there, but They weren't all from there.




  Well, but in 78 there was still no demographic problem, there was the philosophy of providing education to the
  entire population, not just 2%. Because, let's say, 80% went to primary school, and then some went to cycle, others
  went to technical or commercial school, others went to high school, and then very few went to higher education.
  Therefore, at this point there is a reversal of position because in 78 we are already four years away from the revolution, and
  so many teachers are needed. My teachers, when I was a girl, did internships in their 50s, they had been teaching for
  maybe 20 years, until an internship came up so they could do an internship. I saw this because I had classes with
  methodological teachers who had a group of interns to attend and they were all a little younger than my
  mother.



  ## Dilemma: pursue a career in higher education or public education?

  And I, newly graduated, was placed on internship in 78, the year after completing my degree, so this was a boom to
  create more teachers, to meet the needs of mass education. That's what happened at that time. But, at the same time,
  I had also applied to the University of Minho and had been accepted. And then I had this big dilemma: what do I

  I make? Will I do the internship in secondary school and become permanent or will I go as an intern assistant to
  the University of Minho?
Machine Translated by Google
  Against the opinion - I mean, he gave me his opinion and I still remember today and I am very grateful - the head of the
  school secretariat where I had been placed as a trainee teacher, he told me “If you, Doctor, do the internship now, then apply
  for tenure and have a beautiful and secure career.
  If you go to university, you never know when you will have a secure job.” Of course, but we are only 23 years old once,
  and I went on the adventure, but you were completely right, because it took 20 years for me to have job stability, and my
  colleagues who did their internship there, got their jobs the following year. . The paradigm is very different, but I don't
  regret it.



  ## Working at UM



  And then, he came here, and he was already an assistant here at the time when I came to the interview, and he said a
  sentence to me, about working at UM, that stuck with me forever: “You know, this is new here, no one cares. knows
  enough to hate himself.” I thought that phrase was fantastic, because, in fact, in principle, knowledge will give recognition
  and the possibility of establishing partnerships, collaboration, synergies, which we did not find at our alma mater. It was
  deleted and my application, my documents, disappeared. That's all that happened. Therefore, I know that there were people
  who spoke about my candidacy, but then when I went there to retrieve the documents, because we had the right to retrieve
  them, they were not found, nothing appeared. Therefore, I have no idea what happened to my application to be a professor
  at the Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto, an institution that I greatly value, and so do my colleagues. But, in fact,
  the one who gave me the chance to develop the work was the University of Minho, and I came here with a program
  that was in fact very different from the one I had done. Right at the entrance, in the interview, Professor Hélio Alves told me
  that I had to teach classes in English. I said “Okay.” It was a condition that was not problematic for me, and I accepted
  it. And this established a training paradigm that was very different from other universities. I was very happy to work here,
  and I don't know if this question will be further developed in other aspects, about being a student or a teacher, at UM.




  I mean, what was fantastic about working here is that, in fact, it was a new institution, they had a different teaching and
  learning paradigm, we had very small classes, so when you reached 15/16 language students, moved, classes were
  divided. It wasn't your experience. And then the fact that they tried to simulate immersion in the culture of the
  language being taught.
  Therefore, we had English Culture in English, English Linguistics in English, North American Literature in English, English
  Literature in English, and then the course was a Degree in Teaching Portuguese and English, so then there was the
  teaching part and the Portuguese part which were given in Portuguese, and this part was all given in English, and the
  students had to get used to thinking in English. And that was, I think
  me, a sine qua non condition for being an English teacher.

  I don't know how I, with most of the classes given in Portuguese - there were teachers who didn't speak Portuguese, but
  the others taught in Portuguese -, when did I start thinking in English, I think I still It was early, perhaps in my first years of
  teaching here at UM, because I had to work very intensely preparing my classes - I still remember the A5 block format in
  which I wrote my classes, they were always 12 A5 pages, one class of two hours, and it was all written in English and
  I trained like that. When someone in my room noticed that I was dreaming in English, I registered “I'm already dreaming in
  English”, so this is already internalized.




  ## Study opportunities provided by the University of Minho

  As there was an installation committee here and not just a Rectory, this means that there were funds for the installation,
  for the construction of buildings - this Campus was created, the buildings in the City of Braga were rehabilitated to be
  adapted for teaching -, and also there was funding for training. Therefore, because I am a professor at the University of
  Minho, I had access to be able to talk to the managers, the hierarchy
Machine Translated by Google
  from university, so we can go to England on a regular basis and do training. Of course we went
  on vacation. Our holidays, instead of being in the Algarve or somewhere else, were in England,
  for three weeks, and we received a scholarship, and we went there to do a summer course.
  Afterwards, I had funding from the university to go and do a master's degree. I did my Masters in
  Essex, in English Literature, Drama, and then I did my PhD in Warwick, at the University of
  Warwick, in Theater Studies. And, for this, I had the support of the University, paying my salary and
  a scholarship, and later, when I received a scholarship from the Calouste Goulbenkian
  Foundation, my salary continued to be paid to me. I had these conditions that my colleagues at
  other universities did not have. Therefore, I wouldn't trade the possibility of progression, of
  training, that the University of Minho gave for being able to go to the university on foot, which
  would be the case if I stayed in Porto, or if I moved to Porto. So, there was some sort of game
  going on there that I don't know how to explain very well, I just know that the documents disappeared, whic
  Porto, but if I had stayed there I wouldn't have had the advantages I had here. It cost me travel, a good
  part of my life was spent in buses and trains, 3 to 4 hours a day, for many years, but it paid off.
  So, let's say, I was never a student at the University of Minho, but I was funded to study elsewhere
  by the University of Minho, and for that I am very grateful, because I met excellent people, very good
  professionals, who made me open my eyes to other areas of knowing, and then I ended up in the
  theater, as you know.

  The teacher says that her love of languages was one of the reasons she chose this path from an
  early age, but where does this love for Irish literature in particular come from?

  ## The short stick

  Well, it was here, it was here at UM. When we joined here in 78, we were four intern assistants,
 who later became occasional assistants, so in the first year it's always an internship,
 then it was this eventual status, and then we became assistants, and then we had x years to do a
 doctorate and we became assistant professor. Now there is no automatic procedure, everything is
 by competition. And then, - this isn't a very glorious thing to tell - you know that game, or that
 chopstick test, and whoever gets the smallest stick is the one selected, The Short Stick? That's
 more or less how my interest in theater happened. We were four young people, and four or five
 teachers who had already been here for a year or three years, because we were all young, this had
 started in 75, I joined in 78, so no one was much older than me, but there were the old and new,
 these four, we all entered together. And then, there was no one more senior than us, that's what I
 mean, so the distribution of service had to be done among that small academic group because there
 was no one who told us “Give this, give that”, we were the ones who
 we had to distribute the service between us, and my colleagues chose their areas, I came with
 Some very high marks were given to 18th century English literature, about the origins of the novel,
 and it was something that interested me a lot. Other people came with an interest in poetry,
 others came with an interest in romance and literary studies, others in linguistics, others
 in North American literature. I mean, I'm very talkative, but my colleagues spoke first, and chose their
 subjects. And no one chose theater. Because, in the study plan that was designated, there were
 dramatic literatures, and they were: medieval theater, Elizabethan theater and contemporary theater.

  ### A remarkable book and a practical study

  ![alt text](unnamed.jpg)

  The first chair I gave was contemporary English theater, and sometimes we say that there are
  books that changed our lives, and, in fact, there was a book that changed my life, which was the
  book I chose, a collection of plays, to give contemporary English theatre. It was one of Penguin's
  classics, so there were pieces by Yeats, Synge, O'Casey and John Osbourne, so it was the 20th
  century until the 50s/60s, John Osborune in the Angry Young Men generation, people who wrote
  after democratization of teaching in England, in the post-war period, when modern universities were
  created, the Red Brick Universities, and the other authors, by chance, were the three Irish. And I, at that tim
Machine Translated by Google
  I usually tell this story many times, because, in fact, it made a difference in my way of seeing my object of work Liceu, António
  Fonseca, who had disappeared-, I met a friend from college who I already knew before, from my high school days.
  there in 76, and re-emerged in Porto in 78. I found the António Fonseca and then he had been at the CENDREV center,
  at the Center for Theatrical Studies, on the Theater course in Évora, and had returned to Porto – he had suspended his
  enrollment in the Philosophy course she was attending - and went to do the 3-year Theater course. Afterwards, he returned
  to Porto, to work at the Pé de Vento company, at the Seiva Trupe company, and I met Fonseca there next to my house,
  and we were very good friends. And then I said “Oh Fonseca, I really need your help, because I'm going to have to teach
  dramatic literature and I wanted to study the plays with you.”, and then, once a week, Fonseca came to my house and
  we studied the pieces by Sean O'Casey, from Yeats, through an edition that I bought in Spanish, because he didn't



  I read English well, and then we read the plays in Spanish and studied the plays. Therefore, my first approach to
  teaching theater was talking to other people interested in theater, who are actors. And this takes us to a Polish gentleman,
  Jan Cott, who in the post-war period writes a book called Shakespeare Our Contemporary, and he talks about a certain
  revolution in Shakespearean studies that leads academics to talk to practitioners, artists , those who put
  the text into voice. And, in the end, that's what I did, my little revolution was studying the plays that I was going to teach
  with an actor. He wasn't a teacher, he was a colleague, but he brought me a very different approach to what I gathered from
  books, and therefore I had an academic study, and then I had this practical one, without ever having set foot on a stage, I could
  see the other side. And that, I think that in the end, in my choice, it was preponderant for me to think that this was where
  I wanted to come.



  ## The choice of the author who would study

  And, however, when I chose the master's degree, we were exempt from service for three or four years to do a doctorate, but
  as I didn't have a master's degree, I thought there was still a lot I didn't know, and so, during those four years , I spent a year
  doing a master's degree and then I went on to do my doctorate. And then I did a master's degree in English Dramatic Literature,
  in which we also studied Ibsen and other authors all in English translation, at the University of Essex. And I chose Essex
  because the professor who was the director of the course could be my thesis advisor on Synge, because at that time I had
  already made the decision, of those three authors, Yeats, Synge and O'Casey, it was Synge that I I was going to study. Yeats's
  poetry enchanted me, but, at that time, mythology didn't tell me

  as much as you say now; I was very interested in O'Casey because of his political stance and the controversies he
  generated with the Abbey theater, but then, reading his autobiographies, I found that I was unable to relate to that personality
  for 4 years in a row; and then, reading Synge, I found many affinities and many subliminal novelties in those texts, they
  seemed completely traditional texts and then they were so disturbing in a non-pamphleteer way, in a non-programmatic
  way, he just said anything and created chaos, let's say, He was the real shit stirrer. And, therefore, that's how I, studying
  these three Irish authors well, then didn't find it interesting to follow John Osbourne, who was much more modern, in fact,
  John Osbourne even came here to the University of Minho, I was the one who brought him on a visit from the British
  Council, which interested me

  both as an author, but, in fact, the way the Irish use the English language enchanted me, those jokes where we see that
  the syntax isn't right, but it's also English, and I thought that was fantastic. And it was this ability to see a language being
  manipulated in such a different way that enchanted me. And so that's how I came to Irish literature.




  Regarding the evolution of education, do you notice many differences between the time you started and now, perhaps in
  recent years?


  ## Teaching situation in the 70s/80s

  Well, there is a lot of difference, as I said a while ago, the working conditions. When there were language classes, we
  could work with small groups. I didn't give many language classes, I did
Machine Translated by Google
  Technical English, which I really liked, but in language classes, for teachers, for international relations,
  the classes were around 20 students, no more. So these were excellent working conditions. Then,
  in the circumstances of the internship, it was a very privileged circumstance, I pointed this out to
  my students because we were not in a circumstance - for example, in an internship, there are four
  students who go to a school to intern and, according to our model here at the University of Minho, they
  had an advisor for each subject they taught. If a person was going to intern in English/German, they had
  to have an English teacher and a German teacher, who I then coordinated these internships. And at
  university, you also had to have an English advisor and a German advisor. Now, this implies that for those
  four students who were core, there were four dedicated teachers. This was not reproduced anywhere else,
  in the world of teaching.
  having four people working with four students.

  Therefore, this situation was really privileged and allowed anyone who wanted to progress to make
  fantastic progress, because there was a lot of support – of course, there are always variations, nothing
  prevents the circumstances that students bring to university from determining the quality of their
  learning, because we can offer training, but if students are not available to receive it, either because they
  have limitations in their previous learning, or they have occupations, or in fact it was not their choice to
  come to university, social or family impositions, or else a discredit in the intrinsic value of knowledge,
  because in the past we said “go to school to be someone”, there was this notion that knowledge made
  people evolve, made us better people. Then this was equated with providing good jobs. And so, if it no
  longer provides good jobs, then it's not good. No, it is equally good, but this premise of the equation
  is not always verifiable, because, although there are more unemployed people with less education
  than those with a degree, there is no guarantee of employment as there was for me, who had two offers
  at that time. But, just as it was very good for me, it was terrible for the engineers. There were many
  people who took an engineering course, like my husband, who dedicated themselves to teaching and then
  did some small tasks as Engineers.
  punctually, because companies were in contraction and did not employ engineers. By chance, in
  In the case of my husband, he had always been working during university, then moved on to an
  engineering position within his company. Therefore, he never had this difficulty, but we know
  many fellow engineers who made a career in teaching for a few years because there were no jobs for
  engineers in the beginning, in those years, until the 80s, let's say.
  Therefore, the differences in student expectations varied.

  ## The importance of taking students to culture

  One constant throughout the years that I worked here at the University of Minho was that I sought
  always take students to the theater, so they can see another stage besides the one I stood on, which is the
  amphitheater platform. And, in these 45 years, there have always been people who told me “It was the first time I
  to the theater.” And, once, a lady who had come from a factory, was a worker and completed the
  twelfth year of technical education and was able to enter university, said “Oh professor, I never saw
  theater and when, on antenna two”, - because In the past there were only-, two channels “they would
  show plays and I would switch to football”. So 1,000 times football over a television play, and she
  was delighted, happily surprised, by her trip to the theater. And this was back in the 80s, when I was
  able to take people to Lisbon to see plays, there was money to rent a bus to take students there,
  but in recent years that we have been going to the São João theater in Porto, there is also a lot of people
  enter the theater for the first time, and now, supposedly, things are more accessible and there are more
  theaters. But this ability to claim culture as our right has not yet been universally realized. There are
  many people who think this is not a priority.


  Therefore, from that notion that I would call the toga nobility, in the interregnum of 1385, when Dom João
  I was elected king of Portugal, those who advocated the choice of a non-Spanish king were the jurists, they were
  the lawyers, because the nobles, obviously, think that it should be done according to tradition,
  otherwise someone from the street will come and say that they want to own my title of nobility, it doesn't make m
  Therefore, they followed the law and recognized the king of Spain and the queen of Spain as kings of
Machine Translated by Google
  Portugal. Now, other people, including these academics, Doctor Jorge das Regras#? and
  others, advocated the cause of a Portuguese king - of course the king was later very grateful
  and gave them blessings, but, let's say, this is a nobility in a toga, in the toga of academic attire.
  They were people who rose to top positions through their academic career, and now this notion of
  social ascension through education is already a little neglected, and I think that's what meant that,
  for example, more women had it too - it's a more complex subject - but more women had access to
  higher education in the 50s, 60s, 70s, especially the 60s, when the
  Colonial war. Because, in fact, from the moment you have a diploma, you are already a person of
  another social status, regardless of the fact that you are a woman, because these academic or public
  administration degrees were always only available to men, but If you were a woman with a degree,
  it would be more possible to rise to these positions - although we know that there is still a
  long way to go for parity and equality, or even for the recognition of women's right to take up
  certain professions. But, in fact, this all falls within the same parameter of the interest and value of
  knowledge recognized in families as a good in itself. Now, having books at home is also a
  differentiator. There are people who have libraries, there are other people who at that time had
  the telephone directory, and it was the only novel they had at home, lots of characters, no plot. But,
  in fact, the means of access to culture still differentiate the students' position.

  ## The need to stop and reflect

   Therefore, this experience of teaching, of contact with students, we always find people who are
  very interested and people who do this process because it is on their CV - it is almost as if it were
  an assembly line and people don't think much about what they are doing. to do. So, I thought
  Erasmus would be a good antidote to this doldrums. Because during the Erasmus period,
  One day we will have to tell our colleagues in other countries what we do in our country
  course, what our course is like. So, when you have to explain to others what you do, you won't
  just say “Oh, that’s a mess, it’s useless, the teachers are boring”, you’re not giving
  no information, so you have to think about what is studied in the first year, what is studied in the
  second, what is studied in the third, what logic does that have, and then you start to
  understand better What are you doing when you go to university? And even if you don't come
  with good grades, this is a fabulous exercise, that would give you a 10, and then the other learning
  would come together on top of this, because this understanding of what we are doing is what makes
  a student be just a collector of information being the agent of his own training, and that, Erasmus,
  was a good opportunity to take that leap. Of course, there are other people who don't need to go on
  Erasmus to do this, because they came here because they wanted to study that specific thing
  that is studied in the third year, and they suffered the first and second years to be able to do that
  subject. And this, in several courses I have heard people say “I came here because I liked
  anime”, “I came here because I liked literature, North American cinema”, “I came here
  because I liked French poetry”, and therefore, they buy the whole package so they can have that
  icing on the cake, and that is interesting.

  ## Changes in teaching

  Now the other aspect, which is the teaching aspect, how have things changed? They changed a lot
  with the status of the university teaching career. The possibility that I had of going abroad, of
  having time - it could be here in Portugal, many people did it here - to have free time to dedicate to
  research, while being paid, is over. That's over. Now my colleagues have to do their PhDs on top
  of classes, and many of their teachers did this. I think it's unfair, because research needs
  time for silence, time for reflection, and when we have classes with 100/200 students with tests
  to correct, we have very little brain power, very little mental availability to work on our
  investigation. It's painful to see that it's gotten worse. After also University life, with the University
  regulations, there is a period - it seems that only I am the one talking about this -, but there is a
  historical moment in the life of universities that was a resumption of the process since the
  Marquês de Pombal - which for me of good memory - he expelled the Jesuits - he is not of good
  memory for having expelled the Jesuits, he is of good memory because he rebuilt the country and created
Machine Translated by Google
  Porto and all that stuff, and reformed teaching – but Universities were a closed organism, and
  they functioned in their schools as an organism with internal rules. After the expulsion of the Jesuits, university
  rectors began to be appointed by the King. And later, with the Republic, they began to be appointed by the State. Therefore,
  the academic independence of institutions is somewhat shared within this thing, within these parameters. Whoever
  governs us is an academically, obviously respected and honorable person, but who must have the approval of non-academic
  power.



  ## The first truly democratic appointment of a University rector

  There was the 25th of April and people who had been persecuted or prevented from teaching by the fascist regime were
  appointed deans, for example that director of the faculty of humanities who summoned the students to warn them “Things
  are going to change for you”, it was professor Óscar Lopes, the author of the History of Portuguese Literature, who
  was prevented from teaching in public education, and therefore, after the 25th of April, quite rightly, that great literary
  eminence was invited to be the director of the faculty of letters. But, therefore, it was still the State that repaired a wrong
  that the State itself had done before.
  However, here we had Professor Lloyd Braga, who had been nominated by Professor Veiga Simão to come from Mozambique
  and create the University of Minho. It was also appointed by the government, with government funds. Then, Professor Lloyd
  Braga goes to government, becomes Minister, Professor Romero becomes vice-rector, takes on duties, then there are
  elections. The first election of a rector after the 25th of April, in a free society. This happens at the University of Minho.
  The system is: one man, one vote, all
  students and all faculty can vote for this dean. He will be the first rector elected by the academy after the Marquês
  de Pombal took over the administration of the Universities with the expulsion of the Jesuits. And who is elected? Professor
  Lúcio Craveiro da Silva, who had already been the provincial of the Jesuit order in Portugal. Therefore, let's say, from the
  18th century, to the end of the
  XX, suddenly, when the academy is called to elect its leadership, it again chooses a Jesuit - with a very good memory, in fact,
  we have a library named in his name and he was my rector - but I think this is a historical anecdote hilarious, because in fact
  it's almost like going back to the cold cow that was left over from lunch in 1780, or when it was the expulsion of the Jesuits,
  and he was until now - he had been - the only rector of the humanities - if we consider the current rector, the Professor Rui
  Vieira de Castro, who was from Education Sciences, who actually attended the Portuguese and English teaching course
  here, therefore, humanities - a funny thing.
                                  , the first rector elected was of the humanities, of Philosophy, and a Jesuit, which is


  I told this anecdote because that is now completely impossible. We elect representatives who will elect a rector who is
  elected by an electoral college. This, for me, ended the representation of teachers, this seems like a bucket
  thing, it goes like this, one passes to another, passes to the other. It is a fact that abstention is now a very serious
  problem in Western societies that do not include mandatory voting, as in some European countries. But, in any case, it
  felt great to be able to elect my rector, and that is now a privilege that only 20 people have at the moment, and I don't
  find that funny at all, that's my opinion.




  In the middle of her career as a teacher here at the University of Minho, the professor had the opportunity to
  create the course, the degree, in Applied Foreign Languages, and the master's degree. How did this come about?



  ## The possibility of teaching the fruit of research

  Ask me if I had ever thought about that. No. I thought I could come here and teach language at a more advanced level
  and study, continue studying Literature, and then, as it became very clear in the family, I would have a career.
  Therefore, I didn't become a teacher and that's it, I became a teacher. I had to continue studying. For those who didn't
  like studying, it was a sentence, for those who liked studying, it was a toast. But it was there. I never thought about the
  other positions and responsibilities that could be assigned to me, but after a moment when the person becomes
Machine Translated by Google
  career teacher, there are certain functions that we can perform - we probably already had the competence to do it
  before, but we have to be part of the staff, we have to be within the career, we cannot be guest assistants or equivalent
  to assistant professors, we have to be part of the career , in the statutes this has always been like this. And I remember
  that after my doctorate, when I became an assistant professor, my colleague Ana Gabriela - who was one of the four people,
  Professor Ana Gabriela Maciel, who joined me in 1978, the other professor was Dr. Ana Chaves, an eminent translator,
  and the other was a gentleman who studied American studies, his name was Rui something, but he left the University
  after a few years - and she created the first curricular master's degree here at the University of Minho, and I was able to teach
  in this master's degree . The first director of this course was Professor Joseph Mullin, precisely because it was
  necessary to be a higher ranking professor, who was an associate professor, and the promoter, creator of the course,
  was Professor Ana Gabriela Maciel, who at that time was an assistant professor, therefore, by law, she could not be director
  of the course she had created.

  Therefore, from the moment we have the license to dream, we can do fantastic things, even what I'm saying, taking a course
  that I can't manage afterwards. It doesn't matter, what matters is that the course exists. And then I was able to give the
  first seats in Irish theater. Since '78, I had been studying Irish theater and Irish literature to do my research, but I was never
  able to teach that. I taught Shakespeare, I taught English Culture, I taught History of Theater, I taught Technical English to
  engineers, I taught Technical English to Optical Physics, I taught English to International Relations, but there was no Irish
  Literature, and therefore, when this master's degree came up I could finally have a curricular unit that was the result of my
  research. This is very good, because it also opened up a lot of views for me. I was able to create chairs, for example, this
  chair, a theater history option, which I previously gave to teaching degrees, and I was able to learn a lot of things,
  because I studied a lot of different things. But, in fact, sharing the fruits of my academic research with students was only
  possible with that first master's degree. Therefore, this was a dream of my colleague, which we all share here at DEINA.




  ## The creation of the Translation master's degree

  Then, at that time, Professor Azevedo Ferreira was president of the school, and he was from the Portuguese department, but
  he also had French. And he, once, back in Dom Pedro V, when there wasn't this building yet, the Gualtar campus, he told me
  about going to see some courses that were being taken, there were other possibilities of taking courses that
  weren't teaching. At that time we still had classes of 60 students for Portuguese/English and 40 for English/German, so
 we didn't lack students, but the man already had that vision. And I remember that in 90 or so, 98 or 97, professor Eduarda
 Keating and I made a proposal for an Applied Foreign Languages course. He passed school here, at the Institute of Letters
 and Human Sciences at the time, and went to the Senate, and failed. Because at that time, many of the members of the
 Senate, or those who gave their opinion and were later accepted, felt that studying languages alone was not a University
 objective, period. And we closed there. For me, I was very disappointed, because this was at the end of the calendar year,
  and in the spring I had gone to Toulouse to present that course model to the 25th anniversary Congress of Applied
  Foreign Languages courses in France. There were universities that had constituted Faculty of Applied Foreign
  Languages separate from the rest of Letters, because it was a row, as they say in French une fillière, an area of
  development in itself. And when that had created colleges in France, here it was considered a non-university project. Well,
  fortunately, my colleague, professor Eduarda Keating, was not a woman to be left behind with a no, and we continued, and
  created this course. This course started in 99 and was really timely. It was the first in the country and allowed people
  who wanted to study languages, but who did not want to be teachers, to come to the University of Minho, because here
  our courses were teaching or International Relations. And, therefore, another area that did not have history, economics,
  politics, like international relations, but also did not have to have the pedagogies of teaching courses, was needed. Especially
  since the numbers were reducing immensely. Why? Because the demographic implosion that was announced, and which was
  postponed with the return of the population from Africa, with the so-called returnees, who were half a million
  people who countered the effort, the bloodletting that was clandestine immigration, because people in of reproductive
  age had left the country, and the people who were here went from families of five or nine children to one or two. We have
  reached situations where
Machine Translated by Google
  that, for example, there were more students to be German teachers than there were German students
  at school. Complicated, isn't it? Because, who came to study German? They were children of emigrants
  who had gone to Germany, so they had highly competent, fluent German, and so they came here to
  study in English/German, which was a course they were able to take. But then, getting an internship
  or finding a job teaching German was very difficult.

  ### The instability of teachers’ careers at that time

  Then, another social factor was added: every year, in September or August, and until October and November,
  What filled the news in the newspapers and on television was the number of unemployed teachers. All the
  years ago there were 40,000, 50,000, I don't know how many thousand not placed, and they were all
  teachers. This means that it was the only profession that was counted, no one ever said how many
  hundreds of lawyers did not find a job, how many hundreds of psychologists did not
  They found jobs, as journalists... these professions were not counted, nor were there any expectations that
  there would be a job in the state. Therefore, what made the headlines in the newspapers were the unplaced
  teachers. Some were not yet teachers, but they liked to be, and were on the unemployed list. Of course,
  this gave a very bad image of possible employability
  of teachers, and people started to choose other courses. Now, when the Applied Foreign
  Languages course came here to the University of Minho, it brought a lot of people who wanted to do
  exactly that, and in the first year we had many students who transitioned from the teaching courses to
  the Applied Foreign Languages course, because in fact they also shared this notion, “Where or when will I
  have a place in teaching?” And then, they chose another academic line. And that's good, but I continue to
  see, every year, some people from Applied Foreign Languages who take extra courses to get the
  credits needed to go on to do their master's degree in teaching. So now it's turning around. People, as I
  said a while ago, I don't know if I said it, of my group of eight colleagues, I was the only one who wasn't
  retired. The others had been secondary school teachers, they have been retired for 7, 8 or 10
  years, so I only retired at the end of last year, in 2023. In this generation, I don't imagine there are more
  people my age, who entered the teaching career in 78, who are still working. Therefore, this generation
  leaving, there is a huge void - it's like in the case of doctors. So this generation came here to also
  produce places for others, but now there has been a reduction in interest in these courses for some
  time, this will create an implosion. And also here, academically, these older people leaving, who after all,
  I've been here practically since the beginning of the University - 48 and 50 years old, it's not that
  much of a difference -, will open up opportunities for other people. Now if I thought I could

  do this? No I did not know. I didn't know what a university professor did other than teach and open up
  ideas. I learned fantastic things from my teachers, I read books I didn't know existed. I see the quality of
  a teacher in the ability to arouse admiration and novelty.
  Teaching things that people already know is not really a university goal. It is to inspire doubts,
  concerns, questions, to later be resolved by people who have studied other things and who will address
  the questions of their discipline in a different and more informed way. Now, say what they are already
  waiting to hear, they say it into a recorder and they hear themselves, in the end
  cable.


  I, in addition to these courses that are operating quite successfully, the Translation master's degree
  was a little more created by me, it followed the parameters of the European Translation master's
  degree. I wasn't a great lawyer explaining why this course followed the parameters and requirements
  of the EMT, European Masters in Translation, which in fact it does. Therefore, in my applications I
  was unable to bring this quality label, the EMT label, to the University of Minho, but in fact I am aware
  that if I had not attended projects, European research groups, which led to the creation of the European
  Master's Degree in Translation - I was there on this project - this course hadn't existed like that. Therefore,
  I am fully aware that this course is a European master's degree in translation, even without the label,
  because it was created within this philosophy. It allows students to work in a network and
  specialize in their languages. The great added value, the differentiating criterion of this course, is the
  quality of the teachers, and then the fact that students can undergo training in
Machine Translated by Google
  master's degree in languages that do not exist at this level in the rest of the country. I'm talking about Italian, Russian,
  Japanese, because French, English, Spanish and German have master's degrees in almost all universities with these skills,
  now the others don't. And this largely depends on the matrix of this University. We, when we need training, knowledge,
  we don't have to invent it again, we go where it is, and we have Russian teachers here, we have Japanese teachers.
  Therefore, if students come with English and Russian, they can do a master's degree in Russian; if they come with English/
  Japanese, they can do an internship
  In japanese. And we have already had Japanese and Portuguese people doing their master's degree with - by chance two of
  them were my internship students - doing internships in Japanese and passing with grades
  very high levels - and this is also very characteristic of people who study Japanese, many of them are self-taught and are
  very passionate about the subject, therefore, they make the journey from here to Japan, academically, by their own
  means, they are really very dedicated people. And I think it's a privilege to be able to have a course where we can welcome
  these people who, in fact, want to make a difference, and that has happened. So I feel very happy that these two courses
  worked, but I didn't just do these.



  ## Not all projects are a success

  I also completed an integrated training plan, which was a bachelor's degree, master's degree and doctorate. It was
  a degree in European languages and literature, I think, a master's degree in English studies and a PhD in English
  studies as well. When this master's degree was approved and came into operation, a 2-year master's degree, its
  curricular part would be the same as that of the doctorate, but then in the doctorate you had three years to write the
  thesis, and in the master's degree you had one year to complete the thesis. do the dissertation. It was exactly at the
  worst possible moment. The course had people interested, people from Brazil came to take the course and were
  interested, and it was only in Language, English Literature, and Culture too. No, the name of the course was English
  Studies, it was not English Language, Literature and Culture, that continues to operate, but later in the intervening
  years English Studies operated.
  The English Studies course had the limitation that it did not allow for a dissertation in Linguistics, while
  that in the other it was mandatory to have courses in Linguistics and you could do a dissertation in Linguistics,
  the other was just literature and culture. When this course came into operation, an order came from the ministry that
  designated as a criterion for progressing in their career that teachers should have a master's degree in Educational
  Sciences, in teaching. The other master's degrees did not provide career progression. And then, they did not justify
  absences from work or the request to organize their schedule in order to be able to attend classes. At the same time, it
  became mandatory for teachers to spend 45 hours at school. If they missed those 45 hours, they would lose -
  even if they didn't miss classes - their attendance allowance. Therefore, a person who wanted to attend this master's
  degree and was a teacher - which, in general, was the majority of our students, people who had completed their degree
  here and came to do a master's degree - now those who came to do their master's degree, at that time, lost the attendance
  allowance, they had no career progression, they had to study, they had to spend all nights, for zero professional
  benefit. Therefore, they were penalized and had no benefit. Of course, from 16 to 20 regular students, we went to four,
  three, five, and that was quite detrimental for some years for English Studies. Now, the fact that the master's
  degree is entirely given in English attracts many foreign people who come here to train in English. They come from African
  countries, Asian countries, Brazil, and they have a year here, eight seminars, four per semester, all given in English, and
  this allows them to prepare very seriously. And now we have more students, but there was a time when, when there
  was this integrated teaching and research plan, we ended up, in the department, giving up the course because there
  were no students, no one came. For what? To lose money? And that's over. Unlike the Applied Foreign Languages
  and the Translation master's degree, there have been many students and foreign students also come. But then you need
  to remind them that they have to have Portuguese, because the course is prepared for Portuguese speakers, and foreigners
  have to know how to speak Portuguese to attend it.




  So it's not all glory. There are also other things that don't work. It wasn't because the course wasn't good, it was because
  there weren't any students, period. Nobody was going to lose money at that time when the situation was so difficult
  economically. I think that was it. I didn't imagine when
  at the age of 23 I entered the University of Minho, I never imagined that someone would attend courses that
Machine Translated by Google
  I had created it myself, that was neither near nor far on my horizon.

  ## Participation in the organization of your own degree

  I had already had the experience of creating a course in 75 and 74-75. After April 25th,
  universities closed, and in 1975 no one entered higher education. Instead of continuing everything
  as it was, we stopped for a year to reorganize the course, and then, let's say I took the first and
  second year of the courses that the ministry created, and the third, fourth and fifth, a course in which I
  myself was author, because I participated in the joint committee, half teachers, half students,
  that redesigned the Germanic course. And then I attended this course that I myself had helped to
  create. Remember I said a while ago that when we go to Erasmus we have to explain, that happened
  to me here. To create the curriculum and program for each subject, we had to study, alongside
  the teachers who already knew these things - we were 19, 20 years old - the authors, and
  the literature and areas that would be included in each subject that we were going to include in the
  course. Now, this gives us knowledge, preparation, that we don't have when we buy a course that has
  already been taken and we just have to sit in class and take it. Okay, I had to participate in the
  creation of the course that I later took. This, in practical terms, made me go from a student with an
  average of 11 to a student with an average of 14 – an average of 14, no, an average of 16. So, take the
  average, so two years with an average of 11, 11/12, first year 11, second year 12, I then left with an
  average of 14, imagine the excellent grades I had in the third, fourth and fifth. But it was, exactly, because I ch
  I started to see how things worked, and what I needed to do to be a good student. It wasn't to be a
  good student, it was to have more fun, because in my first and second year, I had a lot of fun dating
  and taking notes in December to study for my exams in January.
  The result was 11. Then, when I went to prepare the programs for classes to start in September
  in October, I was obviously sitting in another place mentally, I had other skills. It was a miracle of
  being a bad student, who didn't fail. We were a work group of five, four of my course mates failed,
  I passed, but I passed with an 11. Then in the second year, I passed with a 12, and then I improved.
  Therefore, miracles, there are, are a lot of work. And, in this case, a lot of enthusiasm, because, in
  the end, in my little place, I was changing the world, right? It's a bit of a revolution, a course taught by
  students can't be found anywhere else. I just wish you had the opportunity to take your own
  course, because it's really good, it's empowering, let's say, that's the term. We feel like we are capable
  of doing things, and that is the best feeling
  that there is.




  To finish, just talk about - the teacher herself said that it took a long time to retire, that maybe she
  postponed it a little - what was that decision like?

  ## A postponed but necessary decision

  I could retire in December 2020, and I retired in November 2023. So, 21, 22, 23,
  I postponed the renovation for 3 years. Mentally, I wasn't prepared. I mean, there weren't those labor
  penalties, in 2020 I could retire completely, but my soul wasn't there yet, I hadn't thought about it
  yet. This process of dissociating from such a long professional career has to be done very calmly,
  with a lot of consideration, because it is a very difficult cut.
  big. There are people who leave school and never think about it again, I wasn't capable of doing that.
  In fact, I still have responsibilities, I have master's students for whom I supervise theses, doctoral
  students for whom I also supervise research work, and I'm here now talking to you, I still have
  my office. Therefore, I am gradually separating, today there is a scientific council at the school and I
  am no longer there. So I'm completely oblivious to these bureaucratic parts, which is a good thing.
  Now, the possibility of contacting students and colleagues is still allowed to me. I still think that another
  year or two here will be linked to the university by human ties to carry out the work until the end. And
  then I think that, in the years that I have left - I am in good health, I have no intention
  of being run over by any bus – therefore, in the years I have left, I think I can participate in the
  life of the University in my current situation, which I like. In fact, now

  I have a little more availability, a lot more availability, but I still have some ties and being able to meet
  Maurício here and now, in these circumstances, and see that his academic progress or
  It took me to prepare a master's degree like this, which wasn't in the line of my degree, it fills me with joy.
  Therefore, university still brings me a lot of pleasure and I still come back here with great joy, it is
  not a door that I close and throw away the key, no.
